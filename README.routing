USAGE

The core module is a function which computes a shortest path from a
set of edges and vertices. The function expects data in a specific
format in input.

Some functions are provided for importing data from geometric tables,
and for generating results as geometries.


The shortest_path functions have the following signature:
========================================================

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION shortest_path(sql text, source_id integer, target_id integer, 
                                         directed boolean, has_reverse_cost boolean)
        RETURNS SETOF path_result

Where path_result is:

CREATE TYPE path_result AS (vertex_id integer, edge_id integer, cost float8);

arguments are:

* sql: a SQL query, which should return a set of rows with the
following columns:

- id: an int4 identifier of the edge
- source: an int4 identifier of the source vertex
- target: an int4 identifier of the target vertex
- cost: double precision value of the edge traversal cost. (a negative cost
   will prevent the edge from being inserted in the graph).
- reverse_cost (optional): the cost for the reverse traversal of the
 edge. This is only used when the directed and has_reverse_cost
 parameters are true (see the above remark about negative costs).
- directed: true if the graph is directed
- has_reverse_cost: if true, the reverse_cost column of the SQL
generated set of rows will be used for the cost of the traversal of
the edge in the opposite direction.

A* and Shooting* functions also need:
- x1: double precision value of x coordinate for edge's start vertex
- y1: double precision value of y coordinate for edge's start vertex
- x2: double precision value of x coordinate for edge's end vertex
- y2: double precision value of y coordinate for edge's end vertex

Shooting* function also needs:
- rule: a string with a comma separated list of edge ids which describes
  a rule for turning restriction (if you came along these edges, you can
  pass through the current one only with the cost stated in to_cost column)
- to_cost: a cost of restricted passage (can be very high in a case of
  turn restriction or comparable with an edge cost in a case of traffic light)

For example,

 gid | source | target | cost | x1 | y1 | x2 | y2 | to_cost | rule
-----+--------+--------+------+----+----+----+----+---------+------
  12 |      3 |     10 |    2 |  4 |  3 |  4 |  5 |    1000 | 14
 
means that the cost of going from edge 14 to edge 12 is 1000,
 
and
 
 gid | source | target | cost | x1 | y1 | x2 | y2 | to_cost | rule
-----+--------+--------+------+----+----+----+----+---------+------
  12 |      3 |     10 |    2 |  4 |  3 |  4 |  5 |    1000 | 14, 4
  
means that the cost of going from edge 14 to edge 12 through edge 4 is 1000.


The function returns a set of rows. There is one row for each crossed
edge, and an additional one containing the terminal vertex.
The columns of each row are:

- vertex_id: the identifier of source vertex of each edge. There is one
more row after the last edge, which contains the vertex identifier of
the target path.
- edge_id: the identifier of the edge crossed
- cost: The cost associated to the current edge. It is 0 for the row
after the last edge. Thus, the path total cost can be computated using
a sum of all rows in the cost column.

examples:

SELECT * from shortest_path('SELECT source, id, target, cost FROM edges',
3, 7, false, false);

 vertex_id | edge_id | cost 
-----------+---------+------
         3 |       2 |    0
         4 |      21 |    0
         6 |       5 |    0
         7 |      -1 |    0
(4 rows)


To search a path using the A* algorithm:

SELECT * from shortest_path_astar('SELECT id, source, target, cost, 
x1, y1, x2, y2 FROM edges',3, 7, false, false);

 vertex_id | edge_id | cost 
-----------+---------+------------------------
         3 |       2 |    0.000763954363701041
         4 |      21 |    0.00150254971056274
         6 |       5 |    0.000417442425988342
         7 |      -1 |    0
(4 rows)


Shooting* algorithm calculates a path from edge to edge (not from vertex to
vertex). Column vertex_id contains start vertex of an edge from column edge_id.

To search a path using the Shooting* algorithm:

SELECT * from shortest_path_shooting_star('SELECT id, source, target, cost, 
x1, y1, x2, y2, rule, to_cost FROM edges', 17, 9, true, false);

 vertex_id | edge_id | cost
-----------+---------+------
        16 |      17 |    1
        15 |      16 |    1
         2 |       5 |    1
         3 |       4 |    1
        20 |      12 |    2
        10 |       9 |    2
(6 rows)


The tsp function has the following signature:
============================================

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tsp(sql text, ids varchar, source_id integer)
RETURNS SETOF path_result

arguments are:

* sql: a SQL query, which should return a set of rows with the
following columns:

- source_id: an int4 identifier of the vertex
- x: x coordinate of the vertex
- y: y coordinate of the vertex

* ids: text string containig int4 ids of vertices separated by commas
* source_id: int 4 id of the start point

The function returns a set of rows. There is one row for each crossed
edge, and an additional one containing the terminal vertex.
The columns of each row are:

- vertex_id: the identifier of source vertex of each edge. There is one
more row after the last edge, which contains the vertex identifier of
the target path.
- edge_id: unused, always 0
- cost: unused, always 0

examples:

SELECT * from tsp('select distinct source as source_id, x1::double precision as x, 
y1::double precision as y from dourol where source in (83593,66059,10549,18842,13)',
'83593,66059,10549,18842,13', 10549);

 vertex_id | edge_id | cost
-----------+---------+------
     10549 |       0 |    0
     83593 |       0 |    0
     66059 |       0 |    0
     18842 |       0 |    0
        13 |       0 |    0
(5 rows)

Afterwards vertex_id column can be used for shortest path calculation.


The driving_distance function has the following signature:
=========================================================

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION driving_distance(sql text, source_id integer, distance float8) 

RETURNS SETOF path_result

arguments are:

* sql: a SQL query, which should return a set of rows with the
following columns:

- id: an int4 identifier of the edge
- source: an int4 identifier of the source vertex
- target: an int4 identifier of the target vertex
- cost: an float8 value, of the edge traversal cost. (a negative cost
   will prevent the edge from being inserted in the graph).

* source_id: int4 id of the start point
* distance: float8 value of distance in degrees

The function returns a set of rows. There is one row for each crossed
edge, and an additional one containing the terminal vertex.
The columns of each row are:

- vertex_id: the identifier of source vertex of each edge. There is one
more row after the last edge, which contains the vertex identifier of
the target path.
- edge_id: the identifier of the edge crossed
- cost: The cost associated to the current edge. It is 0 for the row
after the last edge. Thus, the path total cost can be computated using
a sum of all rows in the cost column.

examples:

SELECT * from driving_distance('select gid as id,source,target, 
length::double precision as cost from dourol',10549,0.01);

 vertex_id | edge_id |     cost
-----------+---------+---------------
      6190 |  120220 | 0.00967666852
      6205 |  118671 | 0.00961557335
      6225 |  119384 | 0.00965668162
      6320 |  119378 | 0.00959826176
      .
      .
      .
     15144 |  122612 | 0.00973386526
     15285 |  120471 | 0.00912965866
     15349 |  122085 | 0.00944814966
     15417 |  120471 | 0.00942316736
     15483 |  121629 | 0.00972957546
(293 rows)




The power of SQL can be used for more complex cost computation:

SELECT shortest_path('SELECT gid as id, node1_id as source, node2_id
as target, coalesce(CASE WHEN gid IN
 (1956, 123) THEN 12 ELSE weights1.weight END, 99999) as cost
        FROM lines2 LEFT JOIN weights1 USING (gid)', 12, 78, false, false);




GRAPH IMPORTATION

The shortest_path function expects edges id and vertices id to be
integer ranging from zero to the maximum number of edges or vertices
(holes are allowed, but it will be less efficient).
However, you may want to compute shortest path on a table which has
vertex identifier stored as strings, like in the following example:

SELECT * FROM graph1;

 gid | source_id | target_id | edge_id 
-----+-----------+-----------+---------
   0 | A         | B         |       
   1 | A         | C         |       
   2 | D         | A         |       
   3 | B         | C         |       
(4 rows)

A function called "create_graph_tables" is available which will create
two tables for edges and vertices. Example:

SELECT create_graph_tables('graph1', 'varchar');

The first argument is the name of the table containing the graph, and
the second is the type of the source and target vertex identifiers.

It will create the following tables:

SELECT * FROM graph1_edges;

 id | source | target | cost | reverse_cost 
----+--------+--------+------+--------------
  1 |      1 |      2 |      |             
  2 |      1 |      3 |      |             
  3 |      4 |      1 |      |             
  4 |      2 |      3 |      |             
(4 rows)

And 

 SELECT * FROM graph1_vertices;

 id | geom_id 
----+---------
  1 | A
  2 | B
  3 | C
  4 | D
(4 rows)


Notice the function will also update the edge_id column of graph1:

 gid | source_id | target_id | edge_id 
-----+-----------+-----------+---------
   0 | A         | B         |       1
   1 | A         | C         |       2
   2 | D         | A         |       3
   3 | B         | C         |       4
(4 rows)


Then, you can use the shortest_path function, as below:

SELECT * FROM shortest_path('SELECT id, source, target, 1::float8 AS
                                                cost FROM graph1_edges', 
                (SELECT id FROM graph1_vertices WHERE geom_id = 'A'), 
                (SELECT id FROM graph1_vertices WHERE geom_id = 'C'), 
                                false, false);

The initial table has to contain the following columns:

- gid anyelement: a unique identifier for each edge in you graph
- source_id anyelement: an identifier for the starting vertex of the line
- target_id anyelement: an identifier for the target vertex of the line
  (if the graph is not directed, source or target has the same
meaning)
- edge_id integer: this column will be filled by the allocated edge
identifier. All data there will be overwritten, and you need to create
this column if it does not exists before.

The function "drop_graph_tables" will simply delete the edges and
vertices associated tables. Example:

SELECT drop_graph_tables('graph1');


POSTGIS GEOMETRIES IMPORTATION

Some pl/pgsql functions are available for working with geographical
data from PostGis tables.

The table containing the graph has to contain the columns described in
the previous section, and an additional geometric column called
"the_geom" of type MULTILINESTRING. Only the first line in the
multiline geomety will be handled. This restriction is because the
shp2pgsql tool provided with postgis creates MULTILINESTRING geometric
tables for shapefiles containing a set of lines. The importation
should however handle more that only the first line in the multi line
geometry (see TODO).

Here's an example of such a table:

SELECT gid, source_id, target_id, astext(the_geom) FROM graph2 LIMIT 4;

 gid | source_id | target_id |                                           astext                                           
-----+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0 |           |           | MULTILINESTRING((-0.357902298850575 51.2777105057471,-0.364822129560221 51.455488954023))
   1 |           |           | MULTILINESTRING((-0.415775862068966 51.6386587816092,-0.478232130809596 51.5784636541729))
   2 |           |           | MULTILINESTRING((-0.478232130809596 51.5784636541729,-0.382585141804099 51.5791468469515))
   3 |           |           | MULTILINESTRING((-0.364822129560221 51.455488954023,-0.433824600199901 51.5244914246627))
(4 rows)


If the graph table does not contain identifier values in the source_id
and target_id columns, a function is able to generate such ids, by
extracting the starting and ending points of the line, and generating
an unique id, for all points that are in a given distance. Example:

SELECT assign_vertex_id('graph2', 0.1);

SELECT gid, source_id, target_id, astext(the_geom) FROM graph2 LIMIT 4;

 gid | source_id | target_id |                                           astext                                           
-----+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0 |         1 |         2 | MULTILINESTRING((-0.357902298850575 51.2777105057471,-0.364822129560221 51.455488954023))
   1 |         3 |         3 | MULTILINESTRING((-0.415775862068966 51.6386587816092,-0.478232130809596 51.5784636541729))
   2 |         3 |         3 | MULTILINESTRING((-0.478232130809596 51.5784636541729,-0.382585141804099 51.5791468469515))
   3 |         2 |         2 | MULTILINESTRING((-0.364822129560221 51.455488954023,-0.433824600199901 51.5244914246627))


Now that the source_id and target_id are filled, the function
create_graph_tables() can be used to create the edges
and vertices tables (see above for the detailed description of
create_graph_tables):

SELECT create_graph_tables('graph2', 'int4');

Here's the content of the edges table:

SELECT * FROM graph2_edges LIMIT 3; 

 id | source | target | cost | reverse_cost 
----+--------+--------+------+--------------
  1 |      1 |      2 |      |             
  2 |      3 |      3 |      |             
  4 |      2 |      2 |      |             
(3 rows)

We can see that it contains NULL values for the cost column. 

The function update_cost_from_distance can update the cost column with
the distance of the lines contained in the geometry table, attached to
each edge:

SELECT update_cost_from_distance('graph2');

The costs are now:

SELECT * FROM graph2_edges LIMIT 3; 

 id | source | target |       cost        | reverse_cost 
----+--------+--------+-------------------+--------------
  1 |      1 |      2 | 0.230081516048264 |             
  2 |      3 |      3 | 0.446760794328524 |             
  4 |      2 |      2 | 0.174348470878483 | 


Now, all is set up correctly for using the shortest_path() on these
data:

SELECT * FROM shortest_path('SELECT id, source, target, cost FROM graph2_edges', 
                             1, 2, false, false);

 vertex_id | edge_id | cost 
-----------+---------+------
         1 |       1 |    0
         2 |      -1 |    0

An additional function shortest_path_as_geometry() can be used to
retrieve the result as a set of rows containing the geometry
identifier and the geometry itself:

SELECT gid, astext(the_geom) FROM shortest_path_as_geometry('graph2', 1, 2);

 gid |                                           astext                                           
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0 | MULTILINESTRING((-0.357902298850575 51.2777105057471,-0.364822129560221 51.455488954023))
  22 | MULTILINESTRING((-0.417298850574714 51.3371070574713,-0.408546467391305 51.3885360617191))
(2 rows)


MAPSERVER INTEGRATION

The function shortest_path_as_geometry() can be used inside mapserver
to draw shortest path directly, as in the following example:


LAYER
    NAME "europe2"
    TYPE LINE

    STATUS DEFAULT
    CONNECTIONTYPE postgis
        CONNECTION "user=postgres host=localhost dbname=geo"
        DATA "the_geom from (SELECT the_geom, gid from
          shortest_path_as_geometry('bahnlinien_europa_polyline', 2629, 10171)) as
          foo using unique gid using srid=-1"

    TEMPLATE "t"
    CLASS
      NAME "0"
      STYLE
        SYMBOL "circle"
        SIZE 10
        COLOR 50 50 100
      END
    END
END

Notice however, that this function will be called at each map
display, computing the shortest path every time.

A better approach would be to generate the shortest path in a
temporary table.


LIMITATION / TODO

Usage of the Boost graph library can certainly be optimised. Help from
Boost/STL experts is welcomed.

Might not work on very large datasets due to memory
requirements. (Tested with sucess on a 8 million edges table).
