Bidirectional A* - Family of functions
===============================================================================

The bidirectional A* (pronounced "A Star") algorithm is based on the A*
algorithm.

Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on A* algorithm, the bidirectional search finds a shortest path from
a starting vertex (``start_vid``) to an ending vertex (``end_vid``).
It runs two simultaneous searches: one forward from the ``start_vid``, and one
backward from the ``end_vid``, stopping when the two meet in the middle.
This implementation can be used with a directed graph and an undirected graph.

The main Characteristics are:

.. include:: aStar-family.rst
    :start-after: astar general info start
    :end-before: astar general info end

* For large graphs where there is a path bewtween the starting vertex and ending
  vertex:

  * It is expected to terminate faster than pgr_astar

See :ref:`heuristics <astar_heuristics>` available and :ref:`factor
<astar_factor>` handling.
