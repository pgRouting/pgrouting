Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bellman-Ford's algorithm, is named after Richard Bellman and Lester Ford, who first published it in 1958 and 1956, respectively.
It is a graph search algorithm that computes shortest paths from
a starting vertex (``start_vid``) to an ending vertex (``end_vid``) in a graph where some of the edge weights may be negative number. Though it is more versatile, it is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm/
This implementation can be used with a directed graph and an undirected graph.

The main Characteristics are:
  - Process is valid for edges with both positive and negative edge weights.
  - Values are returned when there is a path.

    - When the start vertex and the end vertex are the same, there is no path. The agg_cost would be 0.

    - When the start vertex and the end vertex are different, and there exists a path between them without having a ‘negative cycle’. The agg_cost would be some finite value denoting the shortest distance between them.
    - When the start vertex and the end vertex are different, and there exists a path between them, but it contains a ‘negative cycle’. In such case, agg_cost for those vertices keep on decreasing furthermore, Hence agg_cost can’t be defined for them.

    - When the start vertex and the end vertex are different, and there is no path. The agg_cost is :math:`\infty`.

  - For optimization purposes, any duplicated value in the `start_vids` or `end_vids` are ignored.

  - The returned values are ordered:

    - `start_vid` ascending
    - `end_vid` ascending

  - Running time: :math:`O(| start\_vids | * ( V * E))`

.. rubric:: Minimal signature

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_bellmanFord(TEXT edges_sql, BIGINT start_vid, BIGINT end_vid)
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

The minimal signature is for a **directed** graph from one ``start_vid`` to one ``end_vid``.

:Example:

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_bellman_ford.queries
   :start-after: -- q1
   :end-before: -- q2

.. index::
    single: bellman_ford(One to One) - Experimental

One to One
...............................................................................

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_bellmanFord(TEXT edges_sql, BIGINT start_vid, BIGINT end_vid,
        BOOLEAN directed:=true);
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

This signature finds the shortest path from one ``start_vid`` to one ``end_vid``:

- On a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
- On an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.

:Example:

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_bellman_ford.queries
   :start-after: -- q2
   :end-before: -- q3

.. index::
    single: bellman_ford(One to Many) - Experimental

One to many
...............................................................................

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_bellmanFord(TEXT edges_sql, BIGINT start_vid, ARRAY[ANY_INTEGER] end_vids,
        BOOLEAN directed:=true);
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, end_vid, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

This signature finds the shortest path from one ``start_vid`` to each ``end_vid`` in ``end_vids``:

- On a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
- On an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.

Using this signature, will load once the graph and perform a one to one `pgr_bellmanFord`
where the starting vertex is fixed, and stop when all ``end_vids`` are reached.

- The result is equivalent to the union of the results of the one to one `pgr_bellmanFord`.
- The extra ``end_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.

:Example:

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_bellman_ford.queries
   :start-after: -- q3
   :end-before: -- q4

.. index::
    single: bellman_ford(Many to One) - Experimental

        BOOLEAN directed:=true);
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, start_vid, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

This signature finds the shortest path from each ``start_vid`` in  ``start_vids`` to one ``end_vid``:

- On a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
- On an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.

Using this signature, will load once the graph and perform several one to one `pgr_bellmanFord`
where the ending vertex is fixed.

- The result is the union of the results of the one to one `pgr_bellmanFord`.
- The extra ``start_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_bellman_ford.queries

        BOOLEAN directed:=true);
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, start_vid, end_vid, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

This signature finds the shortest path from each ``start_vid`` in  ``start_vids`` to each ``end_vid`` in ``end_vids``:

- On a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
- On an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.

Using this signature, will load once the graph and perform several one to Many `pgr_bellmanFord`
for all ``start_vids``.

- The result is the union of the results of the one to one `pgr_bellmanFord`.
- The extra ``start_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.

The extra ``start_vid`` and ``end_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.
