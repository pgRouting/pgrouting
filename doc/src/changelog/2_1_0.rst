Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - A C and C++ library for developer was created

   - encapsulates postgreSQL related functions
   - encapsulates Boost.Graph graphs

     - Directed Boost.Graph
     - Undirected Boost.graph.

   - allow any-integer in the id's
   - allow any-numerical on the cost/reverse_cost columns

 - Three Functions where completly re-factored using the developers library and functionality was added.

   - pgr_dijkstra
   - pgr_ksp
   - pgr_drivingDistance

 - Impreved    
   Alphashape function now can generate better polygons with holes and custom parameter

 - Instead of generating many libraries:
   - All functions are encapsulated in one library
   - The library has a the prefix 2-1-0

 - Added proposed functions to be evaluated:
   - Proposed functions from Steve Woodbridge, (Classified as Convinience by the author.)
      - pgr_pointToEdgeNode - convert a point geometry to a vertex_id based on closest edge.
      - pgr_flipEdges - flip the edges in an array of geometries so the connect end to end.
      - pgr_textToPoints - convert a string of x,y;x,y;... locations into point geometries.
      - pgr_pointsToVids - convert an array of point geometries into vertex ids.
      - pgr_pointsToDMatrix - Create a distance matrix from an array of points.
      - pgr_vidsToDMatrix - Create a distance matrix from an array of vertix_id.
      - pgr_vidsToDMatrix - Create a distance matrix from an array of vertix_id.

   - Added proposed functions from GSoc Projects:
      - pgr_vrppdtw

 - Removed the 1.x legacy functions

 - Some bug fixes in other functions
