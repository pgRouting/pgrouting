Minor bug fixes.

.. rubric:: Bug Fixes

* No track of the bug fixes were kept.

pgRouting 2.0.0 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To see the issues closed by this release see the `Git closed issues for 2.0.0
<https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/issues?q=milestone%3A%22Release+2.0.0%22+is%3Aclosed>`_
on Github.

With the release of pgRouting 2.0.0 the library has abandoned backwards
compatibility to `pgRouting 1.0`_ releases.
The main Goals for this release are:

* Major restructuring of pgRouting.
* Standardization of the function naming
* Preparation of the project for future development.

As a result of this effort:

* pgRouting has a simplified structure
* Significant new functionality has being added
* Documentation has being integrated
* Testing has being integrated
* And made it easier for multiple developers to make contributions.


.. rubric:: Important Changes

* Graph Analytics - tools for detecting and fixing connection some problems in a
  graph
* A collection of useful utility functions
* Two new All Pairs Short Path algorithms (pgr_apspJohnson, pgr_apspWarshall)
* Bi-directional Dijkstra and A-star search algorithms (pgr_bdAstar,
  pgr_bdDijkstra)
* One to many nodes search (pgr_kDijkstra)
* K alternate paths shortest path (pgr_ksp)
* New TSP solver that simplifies the code and the build process (pgr_tsp),
  dropped "Gaul Library" dependency
* Turn Restricted shortest path (pgr_trsp) that replaces Shooting Star
* Dropped support for Shooting Star
* Built a test infrastructure that is run before major code changes are checked
  in
* Tested and fixed most all of the outstanding bugs reported against 1.x that
  existing in the 2.0-dev code base.
* Improved build process for Windows
* Automated testing on Linux and Windows platforms trigger by every commit
* Modular library design
* Compatibility with PostgreSQL 9.1 or newer
* Compatibility with PostGIS 2.0 or newer
* Installs as PostgreSQL EXTENSION
* Return types re factored and unified
* Support for table SCHEMA in function parameters
* Support for ``st_`` PostGIS function prefix
* Added ``pgr_`` prefix to functions and types
* Better documentation: https://docs.pgrouting.org
* shooting_star is discontinued
