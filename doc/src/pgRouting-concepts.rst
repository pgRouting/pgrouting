Graph definition
...............................................................................

A graph is an ordered pair :math:`G = (V ,E)` where:

* :math:`V` is a set of vertices, also called nodes.
* :math:`E \subseteq \{( u, v ) \mid u , v \in V \}`

There are different kinds of graphs:

* Undirected graph

  * :math:`E \subseteq \{( u, v ) \mid u , v \in V\}`

* Undirected simple graph

  * :math:`E \subseteq \{( u, v ) \mid u , v \in V, u \neq v\}`

* Directed graph

  * :math:`E \subseteq \{( u, v ) \mid (u , v) \in (V X V) \}`

* Directed simple graph

  * :math:`E \subseteq \{( u, v ) \mid (u , v) \in (V X V), u \neq v\}`

Graphs:

* Do not have geometries.
* Some graph theory problems require graphs to have weights, called **cost** in
  pgRouting.

In pgRouting there are several ways to represent a graph on the database:

* With ``cost``

  * (``id``, ``source``, ``target``, ``cost``)

* With ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost``

  * (``id``, ``source``, ``target``, ``cost``, ``reverse_cost``)

Where:

.. list-table::
   :width: 81
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Column
     - Description
   * - ``id``
     - Identifier of the edge. Requirement to use the database in a consistent.
       manner.
   * - ``source``
     - Identifier of a vertex.
   * - ``target``
     - Identifier of a vertex.
   * - ``cost``
     - Weight of the edge (``source``, ``target``):

       * When negative the edge (``source``, ``target``) do not exist on the
         graph.
       * ``cost`` must exist in the query.
   * - ``reverse_cost``
     - Weight of the edge (``target``, ``source``)

       * When negative the edge (``target``, ``source``) do not exist on the
         graph.

The decision of the graph to be **directed** or **undirected** is done when
executing a pgRouting algorithm.


Graph with ``cost``
...............................................................................

The weighted directed graph, :math:`G_d(V,E)`:

* Graph data is obtained with a query

  ``SELECT id, source, target, cost FROM edges``

* the set of edges :math:`E`

  * :math:`E = \{(source_{id}, target_{id}, cost_{id}) \text{ when } cost_{id}
    \ge 0 \}`
  * Edges where ``cost`` is non negative are part of the graph.

* the set of vertices  :math:`V`

  * :math:`V = \{source_{id} \cup target_{id}\}`
  * All vertices in ``source`` and ``target`` are part of the graph.

.. rubric:: Directed graph

In a directed graph the edge :math:`(source_{id}, target_{id}, cost_{id})` has
directionality: :math:`source_{id} \rightarrow target_{id}`

For the following data:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- g1
   :end-before: -- g2

Edge :math:`2` (:math:`1 \rightarrow 3`) is not part of the graph.

The data is representing the following graph:

.. graphviz::

   digraph G {
    1 -> 2 [label="  1(5)"];
    3;
   }

.. rubric:: Undirected graph

In an undirected graph the edge :math:`(source_{id}, target_{id}, cost_{id})`
does not have directionality: :math:`source_{id} \frac{\;\;\;\;\;}{}
target_{id}`

* In terms of a directed graph is like having two edges: :math:`source_{id}
  \leftrightarrow target_{id}`

For the following data:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- g1
   :end-before: -- g2

Edge :math:`2` (:math:`1  \frac{\;\;\;\;\;}{} 3`) is not part of the graph.

The data is representing the following graph:

.. graphviz::

   graph G {
    1 -- 2 [label="  1(5)"];
    3;
   }

Graph with ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost``
...............................................................................

The weighted directed graph, :math:`G_d(V,E)`, is defined by:

* Graph data is obtained with a query

  ``SELECT id, source, target, cost, reverse_cost FROM edges``

* The set of edges :math:`E`:

  * :math:`E = \begin{split} \begin{align}
    & {\{(source_{id}, target_{id}, cost_{id}) \text{ when } cost_{id} >=0 \}} \\
    & \cup \\
    & {\{(target_{id}, source_{id}, reverse\_cost_{id}) \text{ when } reverse\_cost_{id} >=0 \}}
    \end{align} \end{split}`
  * Edges :math:`(source \rightarrow target)` where ``cost`` is non negative are
    part of the graph.
  * Edges :math:`(target \rightarrow source)` where ``reverse_cost`` is non
    negative are part of the graph.

* The set of vertices  :math:`V`:

  * :math:`V = \{source_{id} \cup target_{id}\}`
  * All vertices in ``source`` and ``target`` are part of the graph.

.. rubric:: Directed graph

In a directed graph both edges have directionality

* edge :math:`(source_{id}, target_{id}, cost_{id})` has directionality: :math:`source_{id}
  \rightarrow target_{id}`
* edge :math:`(target_{id}, source_{id}, reverse\_cost_{id})` has directionality:
  :math:`target_{id} \rightarrow source_{id}`

For the following data:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- g2
   :end-before: -- g3

Edges not part of the graph:

* :math:`2` (:math:`1  \rightarrow 3`)
* :math:`3` (:math:`3  \rightarrow 2`)

The data is representing the following graph:

.. graphviz::

   digraph G {
    1 -> 2 [label="  1(5)"];
    2 -> 1 [label="  1(2)"];
    3 -> 1 [label="  2(4)"];
    2 -> 3 [label="  3(7)"];
   }

.. rubric:: Undirected graph

In a directed graph both edges do not have directionality

* Edge :math:`(source_{id}, target_{id}, cost_{id})` is :math:`source_{id}
  \frac{\;\;\;\;\;}{} target_{id}`
* Edge :math:`(target_{id}, source_{id}, reverse\_cost_{id})` is
  :math:`target_{id} \frac{\;\;\;\;\;}{} source_{id}`
* In terms of a directed graph is like having four edges:

  * :math:`source_i \leftrightarrow target_i`
  * :math:`target_i \leftrightarrow source_i`

For the following data:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- g2
   :end-before: -- g3

Edges not part of the graph:

* :math:`2` (:math:`1  \frac{\;\;\;\;\;}{} 3`)
* :math:`3` (:math:`3  \frac{\;\;\;\;\;}{} 2`)

The data is representing the following graph:

.. graphviz::

   graph G {
    1 -- 2 [label="  1(5)"];
    2 -- 1 [label="  1(2)"];
    3 -- 1 [label="  2(4)"];
    2 -- 3 [label="  3(7)"];
   }

Graphs without geometries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personal relationships, genealogy, file dependency problems can be solved
using pgRouting. Those problems, normally,  do not come with geometries associated
with the graph.

Wiki example
...............................................................................

Solve the example problem taken from `wikipedia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm>`__):

.. figure:: images/Dijkstra_Animation.gif

Where:

* Problem is to find the shortest path from :math:`1` to :math:`5`.
* Is an undirected graph.
* Although visually looks like to have geometries, the drawing is not to scale.

  * No geometries associated to the vertices or edges

* Has 6 vertices :math:`\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}`
* Has 9 edges:

  :math:`\begin{split} \begin{align}
  E = & \{(1,2,7), (1,3,9), (1,6,14), \\
  & (2,3,10), (2,4,13), \\
  & (3,4,11), (3,6,2), \\
  & (4,5,6), \\
  & (5,6,9) \}
  \end{align} \end{split}`

* The graph can be represented in many ways for example:

.. graphviz::

   graph G {
    rankdir="LR";
    1 [color="red"];
    5 [color="green"];
    1 -- 2 [label="  (7)"];
    5 -- 6 [label="  (9)"];
    1 -- 3 [label="  (9)"];
    1 -- 6 [label="  (14)"];
    2 -- 3 [label="  (10)"];
    2 -- 4 [label="  (13)"];
    3 -- 4 [label="  (11)"];
    3 -- 6 [label="  (2)"];
    4 -- 5 [label="  (6)"];
   }


Prepare the database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a database for the example, access the database and install pgRouting: ::

   $ createdb wiki
   $ psql wiki
   wiki =# CREATE EXTENSION pgRouting CASCADE;

Create a table
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The basic elements needed to perform basic routing on an undirected graph are:

.. list-table::
   :width: 81
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Column
     - Type
     - Description
   * - ``id``
     - **ANY-INTEGER**
     - Identifier of the edge.
   * - ``source``
     - **ANY-INTEGER**
     - Identifier of the first end point vertex of the edge.
   * - ``target``
     - **ANY-INTEGER**
     - Identifier of the second end point vertex of the edge.
   * - ``cost``
     - **ANY-NUMERICAL**
     - Weight of the edge (``source``, ``target``)

Where:

:ANY-INTEGER: SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT
:ANY-NUMERICAL: SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT, REAL, FLOAT

.. no_geometry_start

Using this table design for this example:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- q1
   :end-before: -- q2

Insert the data
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- q2
   :end-before: -- q3

Find the shortest path
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To solve this example :doc:`pgr_dijkstra` is used:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- q3
   :end-before: -- q4

To go from :math:`1` to :math:`5` the path goes thru the following vertices:
:math:`1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 5`

.. graphviz::

   graph G {
    rankdir="LR";
    1 [color="red"];
    5 [color="green"];
    1 -- 2 [label="  (7)"];
    5 -- 6 [label="  (9)", color="blue"];
    1 -- 3 [label="  (9)", color="blue"];
    1 -- 6 [label="  (14)"];
    2 -- 3 [label="  (10)"];
    2 -- 4 [label="  (13)"];
    3 -- 4 [label="  (11)"];
    3 -- 6 [label="  (2)", color="blue"];
    4 -- 5 [label="  (6)"];
   }

Vertex information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To obtain the vertices information, use :doc:`pgr_extractVertices`

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- q4
   :end-before: -- q5

Create a routing Database
...............................................................................

The first step is to create a database and load pgRouting in the database.

Typically create a database for each project.

Once having the database to work in, load your data and build the routing
application in that database.

.. parsed-literal::

	createdb sampledata
	psql sampledata -c "CREATE EXTENSION pgrouting CASCADE"

Load Data
...............................................................................

There are several ways to load your data into pgRouting.

* Manually creating a database.

  * `Graphs without geometries`_
  * :doc:`sampledata`: a small graph used on the documentation examples

* Using `osm2pgrouting
  <https://workshop.pgrouting.org/latest/en/basic/data.html>`__

There are various open source tools that can help, like:

:shp2pgsql: - postgresql shapefile loader
:ogr2ogr: - vector data conversion utility
:osm2pgsql: - load OSM data into postgresql

Please note that these tools will **not** import the data in a structure
compatible with pgRouting and when this happens the topology needs to be
adjusted.

* Breakup a segments on each segment-segment intersection
* When missing, add columns and assign values to ``source``, ``target``,
  ``cost``, ``reverse_cost``.
* Connect a disconnected graph.
* Create the complete graph topology
* Create one or more graphs based on the application to be developed.

  * Create a contracted graph for the high speed roads
  * Create graphs per state/country

In few words:

   Prepare the graph

What and how to prepare the graph, will depend on the application and/or on the
quality of the data and/or on how close the information is to have a topology
usable by pgRouting and/or some other factors not mentioned.

The steps to prepare the graph involve geometry operations using `PostGIS
<https://postgis.net/>`__ and some others involve graph operations like
:doc:`pgr_contraction` to contract a graph.

The `workshop <https://workshop.pgrouting.org/latest>`__ has a step by step on
how to prepare a graph using Open Street Map data, for a small application.

The use of indexes on the database design in general:

* Have the geometries indexed.
* Have the identifiers columns indexed.

Please consult the `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/>`__
documentation and the `PostGIS <https://postgis.net/>`__ documentation.


Build a routing topology
...............................................................................

The basic information to use the majority of the pgRouting functions ``id,
source, target, cost, [reverse_cost]`` is what in pgRouting is called the
routing topology.

``reverse_cost`` is optional but strongly recommended to have in order to reduce
the size of the database due to the size of the geometry columns.
Having said that, in this documentation ``reverse_cost`` is used in this
documentation.

When the data comes with geometries and there is no routing topology, then this
step is needed.

All the start and end vertices of the geometries need an identifier that is to
be stored in a ``source`` and ``target`` columns of the table of the data.
Likewise, ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost`` need to have the value of traversing the
edge in both directions.

If the columns do not exist they need to be added to the table in question. (see
`ALTER TABLE <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html>`__)

The function :doc:`pgr_extractVertices` is used to create a vertices table
based on the edge identifier and the geometry of the edge of the graph.

Finally using the data stored on the vertices tables the ``source`` and
``target`` are filled up.

See :doc:`sampledata` for an example for building a topology.

Data coming from OSM and using `osm2pgrouting
<https://github.com/pgRouting/osm2pgrouting>`__ as an import tool, comes with
the routing topology. See an example of using ``osm2pgrouting`` on the `workshop
<https://workshop.pgrouting.org/latest/en/basic/data.html>`__.

Adjust costs
...............................................................................

For this example the ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost`` values are going to be the
double of the length of the geometry.

Update costs to length of geometry
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Suppose that ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost`` columns in the sample data represent:

* :math:`1` when the edge exists in the graph
* :math:`-1` when the edge does not exist in the graph

Using that information updating to the length of the geometries:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- topo1
   :end-before: -- topo2

Which gives the following results:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- topo2
   :end-before: -- topo3

Note that to be able to follow the documentation examples, everything is based
on the original graph.

Returning to the original data:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- topo3
   :end-before: -- topo4

Update costs based on codes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Other datasets, can have a column with values like

* ``FT`` vehicle flow on the direction of the geometry
* ``TF`` vehicle flow opposite of the direction of the geometry
* ``B`` vehicle flow on both directions

Preparing a code column for the example:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- topo4
   :end-before: -- topo5

Adjusting the costs based on the codes:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- topo5
   :end-before: -- topo6

Which gives the following results:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- topo6
   :end-before: -- topo7

Returning to the original data:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- topo7
   :end-before: -- topo8


Check the Routing Topology
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. contents::
    :local:

There are lots of possible problems in a graph.

* The data used may not have been designed with routing in mind.
* A graph has some very specific requirements.
* The graph is disconnected.
* There are unwanted intersections.
* The graph is too large and needs to be contracted.
* A sub graph is needed for the application.
* and many other problems that the pgRouting user, that is the application
  developer might encounter.

Crossing edges
...............................................................................

.. cross_edges_start

To get the crossing edges:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- cross1
   :end-before: -- cross2

.. figure:: images/crossing_edges.png

That information is correct, for example, when in terms of vehicles, is it a
tunnel or bride crossing over another road.

It might be incorrect, for example:

1. When it is actually an intersection of roads, where vehicles can make turns.
2. When in terms of electrical lines, the electrical line is able to switch
   roads even on a tunnel or bridge.

When it is incorrect, it needs fixing:

1. For vehicles and pedestrians

   * If the data comes from OSM and was imported to the database using
     ``osm2pgrouting``, the fix needs to be done in the `OSM portal
     <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`__ and the data imported again.
   * In general when the data comes from a supplier that has the data prepared
     for routing vehicles, and there is a problem, the data is to be fixed from
     the supplier

2. For very specific applications

   * The data is correct when from the point of view of routing vehicles or
     pedestrians.
   * The data needs a local fix for the specific application.

Once analyzed one by one the crossings, for the ones that need a local fix,
the edges need to be `split <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Split.html>`__.

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- cross2
   :end-before: -- cross3

The new edges need to be added to the edges table, the rest of the attributes
need to be updated in the new edges, the old edges need to be
removed and the routing topology needs to be updated.

Adding split edges
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For each pair of crossing edges a process similar to this one must be performed.

The columns inserted and the way are calculated are based on the application.
For example, if the edges have a trait **name**, then that column is to be
copied.

For pgRouting calculations

* **factor** based on the position of the intersection of the edges can be used
  to adjust the ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost`` columns.
* Capacity information, used on the :doc:`flow-family` functions does not need
  to change when splitting edges.

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- cross3
   :end-before: -- cross4

Adding new vertices
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After adding all the split edges required by the application, the newly created
vertices need to be added to the vertices table.

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- cross4
   :end-before: -- cross5

Updating edges topology
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- cross5
   :end-before: -- cross6

Removing the surplus edges
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once all significant information needed by the application has been transported
to the new edges, then the crossing edges can be deleted.

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- cross6
   :end-before: -- cross7

There are other options to do this task, like creating a view, or a materialized
view.

Updating vertices topology
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To keep the graph consistent, the vertices topology needs to be updated

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- cross7
   :end-before: -- cross8

Checking for crossing edges
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are no crossing edges on the graph.

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- cross8
   :end-before: -- cross9

.. cross_edges_end

Disconnected graphs
...............................................................................

.. connecting_graph_start

To get the graph connectivity:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- connect2
   :end-before: -- connect3

In this example, the component :math:`2` consists of vertices :math:`\{2, 4\}`
and both vertices are also part of the dead end result set.

This graph needs to be connected.

.. Note::
   With the original graph of this documentation, there would be 3 components as
   the crossing edge in this graph is a different component.

Prepare storage for connection information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- connect3
   :end-before: -- connect4

Save the vertices connection information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- connect4
   :end-before: -- connect5

Save the edges connection information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- connect5
   :end-before: -- connect6

Get the closest vertex
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using :doc:`pgr_findCloseEdges` the closest vertex to component :math:`1` is
vertex :math:`4`. And the closest edge to vertex :math:`4` is edge :math:`14`.

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- connect6
   :end-before: -- connect7

The ``edge`` can be used to connect the components, using the ``fraction``
information about the edge :math:`14` to split the connecting edge.

Connecting components
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are three basic ways to connect the components

* From the vertex to the starting point of the edge
* From the vertex to the ending point of the edge
* From the vertex to the closest vertex on the edge

  * This solution requires the edge to be split.

The following query shows the three ways to connect the components:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- connect7
   :end-before: -- connect8

Checking components
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ignoring the edge that requires further work. The graph is now fully connected
as there is only one component.

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- connect8
   :end-before: -- connect9

.. connecting_graph_end

Contraction of a graph
...............................................................................

The graph can be reduced in size using :doc:`contraction-family`

When to contract will depend on the size of the graph, processing times,
correctness of the data, on the final application, or any other factor not
mentioned.

A fairly good method of finding out if contraction can be useful is because of
the number of dead ends and/or the number of linear edges.

A complete method on how to contract and how to use the contracted graph is
described on :doc:`contraction-family`

.. degree_from_table_start

Dead ends
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To get the dead ends:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- contract1
   :end-before: -- contract2

That information is correct, for example, when the dead end is on the limit of
the imported graph.

Visually node :math:`4` looks to be as start/ending of 3 edges, but it is not.

Is that correct?

* Is there such a small curb:

  * That does not allow a vehicle to use that visual intersection?
  * Is the application for pedestrians and therefore the pedestrian can easily
    walk on the small curb?
  * Is the application for the electricity and the electrical lines than can
    easily be extended on top of the small curb?

* Is there a big cliff and from eagles view look like the dead end is close to
  the segment?

When there are many dead ends, to speed up, the :doc:`contraction-family`
functions can be used to divide the problem.

Linear edges
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To get the linear edges:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: -- contract2
   :end-before: -- contract3

This information is correct, for example, when the application is taking into
account speed bumps, stop signals.

When there are many linear edges, to speed up, the :doc:`contraction-family`
functions can be used to divide the problem.

.. degree_from_table_end

Function's structure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the graph preparation work has been done above, it is time to use a

The general form of a pgRouting function call is:

.. admonition:: \ \
   :class: signatures

    pgr_<name>(`Inner queries`_, **parameters**, [ ``Optional parameters``)

Where:

* `Inner queries`_: Are compulsory parameters that are ``TEXT`` strings
  containing SQL queries.
* **parameters**: Additional compulsory parameters needed by the function.
* ``Optional parameters``: Are non compulsory **named** parameters that have a
  default value when omitted.

The compulsory parameters are positional parameters, the optional parameters are
named parameters.

For example, for this :doc:`pgr_dijkstra` signature:

.. admonition:: \ \
   :class: signatures

   pgr_dijkstra(`Edges SQL`_, **start vid**, **end vid**  [, ``directed``])

* `Edges SQL`_:

  * Is the first parameter.
  * It is compulsory.
  * It is an inner query.
  * It has no name, so **Edges SQL** gives an idea of what kind of inner query
    needs to be used

* **start vid**:

  * Is the second parameter.
  * It is compulsory.
  * It has no name, so **start vid** gives an idea of what the second
    parameter's value should contain.

* **end vid**

  * Is the third parameter.
  * It is compulsory.
  * It has no name, so **end vid** gives an idea of what the third
    parameter's value should contain

* ``directed``

  * Is the fourth parameter.
  * It is optional.
  * It has a name.

The full description of the parameters are found on the `Parameters`_ section of
each function.

Function's overloads
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A function might have different overloads. The most common are called:

* `One to One`_
* `One to Many`_
* `Many to One`_
* `Many to Many`_
* `Combinations`_

Depending on the overload the parameters types change.

* **One**: **ANY-INTEGER**
* **Many**: ``ARRAY`` [ **ANY-INTEGER** ]

Depending of the function the overloads may vary. But the concept of parameter
type change remains the same.

One to One
...............................................................................

When routing from:

* From **one** starting vertex
* to **one** ending vertex

One to Many
...............................................................................

When routing from:

* From **one** starting vertex
* to **many** ending vertices

Many to One
...............................................................................

When routing from:

* From **many** starting vertices
* to **one** ending vertex

Many to Many
...............................................................................

When routing from:

* From **many** starting vertices
* to **many** ending vertices

Combinations
...............................................................................

When routing from:

* From **many** different starting vertices
* to **many** different ending vertices
* Every tuple specifies a pair of a start vertex and an end vertex
* Users can define the combinations as desired.
* Needs a `Combinations SQL`_

Inner Queries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. contents::
    :local:

There are several kinds of valid inner queries and also the columns returned are
depending of the function.
Which kind of inner query will depend on the function(s) requirements.
To simplify variety of types, **ANY-INTEGER** and **ANY-NUMERICAL** is used.

For the Routing functions
...............................................................................

To get faster results bound the queries to an area of interest of routing.

In this example Use an inner query SQL that does not include some edges in the
routing function and is within the area of the results.
