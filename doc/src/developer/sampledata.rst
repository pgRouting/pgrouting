Sample Data
===============================================================================

The documentation provides very simple example queries based on a small sample network.
To be able to execute the sample queries, run the following SQL commands to create a table with a small network data set.


.. rubric:: Create table

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tools/testers/sampledata.sql
   :start-after: --EDGE TABLE CREATE
   :end-before: --EDGE TABLE ADD DATA


.. rubric:: Insert data

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tools/testers/sampledata.sql
   :start-after: --EDGE TABLE ADD DATA
   :end-before: --EDGE TABLE TOPOLOGY


Before you test a routing function use this query to fill the source and target columns.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tools/testers/sampledata.sql
   :start-after: --EDGE TABLE TOPOLOGY
   :end-before: --POINTS CREATE

.. rubric:: Points of interest

When points outside of the graph

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tools/testers/sampledata.sql
   :start-after: --POINTS CREATE
   :end-before: --RESTRICTIONS CREATE

.. rubric:: Restrictions

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tools/testers/sampledata.sql
   :start-after: --RESTRICTIONS CREATE
   :end-before: --RESTRICTIONS END


Images
------

* Red arrows correspond when ``cost`` > 0 in the edge table.
* Blue arrows correspond when ``reverse_cost`` > 0 in the edge table.
* Points are outside the graph.
* Click on the graph to enlarge.

.. note:: On all graphs, 

.. rubric:: Network for queries marked as ``directed`` and ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost`` columns are used:

When working with city networks, this is recommended for point of view of vehicles.

   **Graph 1: Directed, with cost and reverse cost**


.. rubric:: Network for queries marked as ``undirected`` and ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost`` columns are used:

When working with city networks, this is recommended for point of view of pedestrians.

.. rubric:: Network for queries marked as ``directed`` and only ``cost`` column is used:
