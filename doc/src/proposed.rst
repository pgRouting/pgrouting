.. warning:: Proposed functions for next mayor release.

  - They are not officially in the current release.
  - They will likely officially be part of the next mayor release:

    - The functions make use of ANY-INTEGER and ANY-NUMERICAL
    - Name might not change. (But still can)
    - Signature might not change. (But still can)
    - Functionality might not change. (But still can)
    - pgTap tests have being done. But might need more.

.. warning:: Experimental functions

  - They are not officially of the current release.
  - They likely will not be officially be part of the next release:

    - The functions might not make use of ANY-INTEGER and ANY-NUMERICAL
    - Name might change.
    - Signature might change.
    - Functionality might change.
    - pgTap tests might be missing.
    - Might need c/c++ coding.
    - May lack documentation.
    - Documentation if any might need to be rewritten.
    - Documentation examples might need to be automatically generated.
    - Might need a lot of feedback from the comunity.
    - Might depend on a proposed function of pgRouting
    - Might depend on a deprecated function of pgRouting
