Migration guide
===============================================================================

Several functions are having changes on the signatures, and/or have been
replaced by new functions.

Results can be different because of the changes.

.. warning::
   All deprecated functions will be removed on next major version 4.0.0

Migration of ``pgr_alphaShape``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Deprecated: `v3.8.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/3.8>`__
:Removed: `v4.0.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/4.0>`__

**Before Deprecation:** The following was calculated:

* An alphaShape was calculated

**After Deprecation:**

PostGIS has two ways of generating alphaShape.

If you have SFCGAL, which you can install using

::

  CREATE EXTENSION postgis_sfcgal

* Since PostGIS 3.5+ use `CG_AlphaShape <https://postgis.net/docs/CG_AlphaShape.html>`__
* For PostGIS 3.5+ use the old name ``ST_AlphaShape``

Other PostGIS options are

* `ST_ConvexHull <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ConvexHull.html>`__
* `ST_ConcaveHull <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ConcaveHull.html>`__

Migration of ``pgr_bdDijkstra``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting from `v4.0.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/4.0/en/migration.html>`__
:doc:`pgr_bdDijkstra` result columns are being standardized.

Migration of ``pgr_nodeNetwork``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Deprecated: `v3.8.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/3.8>`__
:Removed: `v4.0.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/4.0>`__

**Before Deprecation:** A table with `<edges>_nodded` was created. with split
edges.

**Migration**

Use :doc:`pgr_separateTouching` and/or use :doc:`pgr_separateCrossing`

Migration of ``pgr_createTopology``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Deprecated: `v3.8.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/3.8>`__
:Removed: `v4.0.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/4.0>`__

**Before Deprecation:** The following was calculated:

* A table with `<edges>_vertices_pgr` was created.

**After Deprecation:** The user is responsible to create the complete topology.

.. include:: pgRouting-concepts.rst
   :start-after: createTopology_start
   :end-before: createTopology_end

Migration of ``pgr_createVerticesTable``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Deprecated: `v3.8.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/3.8>`__
:Removed: `v4.0.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/4.0>`__

**Before Deprecation:** The following was calculated:

* A table with `<edges>_vertices_pgr` was created.

**After Deprecation:** The user is responsible to create the vertices table,
indexes, etc. They may use :doc:`pgr_extractVertices` for that purpose.

.. literalinclude:: sampledata.queries
   :start-after: -- q1
   :end-before: -- q1-1

Migration of ``pgr_analyzeOneWay``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Deprecated: `v3.8.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/3.8>`__
:Removed: `v4.0.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/4.0>`__

**Before Deprecation:** The following was calculated:

* Number of potential problems in directionality

WHERE

Directionality problems were calculated based on codes.

.. rubric:: Dead ends.

A routing problem can arise when from a vertex there is only a way on or a way
out but not both:

Either saving or using directly :doc:`pgr_extractVertices` get the dead ends
information and determine if the adjacent edge is one way or not.

In this example :doc:`pgr_extractVertices` has already been applied.

.. literalinclude:: migration.queries
   :start-after: --OneWay1
   :end-before: --OneWay2

.. rubric:: Bridges.

Another routing problem can arise when there is an edge of an undirected graph
whose deletion increases its number of connected components, and the bridge is
only one way.

To determine if the bridges are or not one way.

.. literalinclude:: migration.queries
   :start-after: --OneWay2
   :end-before: --OneWay3

Migration of ``pgr_analyzeGraph``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Deprecated: `v3.8.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/3.8>`__
:Removed: `v4.0.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/4.0>`__

**Before Deprecation:** The following was calculated:

* Number of isolated segments.
* Number of dead ends.
* Number of potential gaps found near dead ends.
* Number of intersections. (between 2 edges)

WHERE

:Graph component: A connected subgraph that is not part of any larger connected
                  subgraph.
:Isolated segment: A graph component with only one segment.
:Dead ends: A vertex that participates in only one edge.
:gaps: Space between two geometries.
:Intersection: Is a topological relationship between two geometries.

.. rubric:: Migration.

.. rubric:: Components.

Instead of counting only isolated segments, determine all the components of the
graph.

Depending of the final application requirements use:

* :doc:`pgr_connectedComponents`
* :doc:`pgr_strongComponents`
* :doc:`pgr_biconnectedComponents`

For example:

.. literalinclude:: migration.queries
   :start-after: --analysis1
   :end-before: --analysis2

.. rubric:: Dead ends.

Instead of counting the dead ends, determine all the dead ends of the graph
using :doc:`pgr_degree`.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: migration.queries
   :start-after: --analysis2
   :end-before: --analysis3

.. rubric:: Potential gaps near dead ends.

Instead of counting potential gaps between geometries, determine the geometric
gaps in the graph using :doc:`pgr_findCloseEdges`.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: migration.queries
   :start-after: --analysis3
   :end-before: --analysis4

.. rubric::  Topological relationships.

Instead of counting intersections, determine topological relationships between
geometries.

Several PostGIS functions can be used:
`ST_Intersects <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Intersects.html>`__,
`ST_Crosses <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Crosses.html>`__,
`ST_Overlaps <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Overlaps.html>`__, etc.

.. literalinclude:: migration.queries
   :start-after: --analysis4
   :end-before: --analysis5

Signature to be migrated:

.. parsed-literal::

  pgr_maxCardinalityMatch(Edges SQL, [directed])
   RETURNS SETOF (seq, edge, source, target)

Migration is needed, because:

* Use ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost`` on the inner query
* Results are ordered
* Works for undirected graphs.
* New signature

  * ``pgr_maxCardinalityMatch(text)`` returns only ``edge`` column.
  * The optional flag ``directed`` is removed.

:Before migration:

* Columns used are ``going`` and ``coming`` to represent the existence of an
  edge.
* Flag ``directed`` was used to indicate if it was for a **directed** or
  **undirected** graph.

  * The flag ``directed`` is ignored.

    * Regardless of it's value it gives the result considering the graph as
      **undirected**.

:Migration:

* Use the columns ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost`` to represent the existence of an
  edge.
* Do not use the flag ``directed``.
* In the query returns only ``edge`` column.

Migration of restrictions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting from `v3.4.0 <https://docs.pgrouting.org/3.4/en/migration.html>`__

The structure of the restrictions have changed:

Old restrictions structure
...............................................................................

On the deprecated signatures:

* Column ``rid`` is ignored
* ``via_path``

  * Must be in reverse order.
  * Is of type ``TEXT``.
  * When more than one via edge must be separated with ``,``.

* ``target_id``

  * Is the last edge of the forbidden path.
  * Is of type ``INTEGER``.

* ``to_cost``

  * Is of type ``FLOAT``.

Creation of the old restrictions table

.. literalinclude:: migration.queries
   :start-after: --rest00
   :end-before: --rest01

Old restrictions fill up

.. literalinclude:: migration.queries
   :start-after: --rest01
   :end-before: --rest1

Old restrictions contents
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. literalinclude:: migration.queries
   :start-after: --rest1
   :end-before: --rest2

The restriction with ``rid = 2`` is representing :math:`3 \rightarrow 5
\rightarrow9`

* :math:`3\rightarrow5`

  * is on column ``via_path`` in reverse order
  * is of type ``TEXT``

* :math:`9`

  * is on column ``target_id``
  * is of type ``INTEGER``


New restrictions structure
...............................................................................

* Column ``id`` is ignored
* Column ``path``

  * Is of type ``ARRAY[ANY-INTEGER]``.
  * Contains all the edges involved on the restriction.
  * The array has the ordered edges of the restriction.

* Column ``cost``

  * Is of type ``ANY-NUMERICAL``

.. include:: sampledata.rst
   :start-after: the_restrictions_start
   :end-before: the_restrictions_end


The restriction with ``rid = 2`` represents the path :math:`3 \rightarrow5
\rightarrow9`.

* By inspection the path is clear.

Migration
...............................................................................

To transform the old restrictions table to the new restrictions structure,

* Create a new table with the new restrictions structure.

  * In this migration guide ``new_restrictions`` is been used.

* For this migration pgRouting supplies an auxiliary function for reversal of an
  array ``_pgr_array_reverse`` needed for the migration.

  * ``_pgr_array_reverse``:

    * Was created temporally for this migration
    * Is not documented.
    * Will be removed on the next mayor version 4.0.0
