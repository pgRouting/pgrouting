Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The prim algorithm was developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtěch Jarník.
It is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted
undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree
that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree
is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time,
from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible
connection from the tree to another vertex.

This algorithms find the minimum spanning forest in a possibly disconnected
graph; in contrast, the most basic form of Prim's algorithm only finds minimum
spanning trees in connected graphs. However, running Prim's algorithm separately
for each connected component of the graph, then it is called minimum spanning
forest.

**The main characteristics are:**

- It's implementation is only on **undirected graph**.
- Process is done only on edges with positive costs.
- Span start from chosen root_vertex resulting subgraph.

  - When root vertex is not given then result is minimun spanning tree of disconnected graph.

- Values are returned when there is a minimum spanning tree.

  - When there is no edge in graph then EMPTY SET is return.

- The minimum spanning tree is same for any root vertex.
- Running time: :math:`O(E*log V)`

.. Note: From boost Graph:
   "The algorithm as implemented in Boost.Graph does not produce correct results on graphs with parallel edges."



Signatures

.. index::
    single: prim - Experimental

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_prim(edges_sql)
    pgr_prim(edges_sql, root_vertex)

    RETURNS SET OF (seq, root_vertex, node, edge, cost, agg_cost, tree_cost)
       or EMPTY SET

The signature is for a **undirected** graph.

.. rubric:: pgr_prim without root vertex

:Example:

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_prim(TEXT edges_sql);
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, root_vertex, node, edge, cost, agg_cost, tree_cost) or EMPTY SET

When root vertex is not given then result is MST of disconnected graph.

.. rubric:: pgr_prim with root vertex

:Example:

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_prim(TEXT edges_sql, BIGINT root_vertex);
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, root_vertex, node, edge, cost, agg_cost, tree_cost) or EMPTY SET

Results is subgraph which contain root_vertex.

Parameters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=================== ====================== ========= =================================================
Parameter           Type                   Default   Description
=================== ====================== ========= =================================================
**edges_sql**       ``TEXT``                         SQL query as described above.
**root_vertex**     ``BIGINT``                       Root vertex from where spanning of tree start and
                                                     resulting in subgraph.

                                                     - In the absence of root vertex the result is
                                                       MST of disconnected graph.
=================== ====================== ========= =================================================

Inner query
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:edges_sql: an SQL query, which should return a set of rows with the following columns:

================= =================== ======== =================================================
Column            Type                 Default  Description
================= =================== ======== =================================================
**id**            ``ANY-INTEGER``                Identifier of the edge.
**source**        ``ANY-INTEGER``                Identifier of the first end point vertex of the edge.
**target**        ``ANY-INTEGER``                Identifier of the second end point vertex of the edge.
**cost**          ``ANY-NUMERICAL``              Weight of the edge  `(source, target)`

                                                 - When negative: edge `(source, target)` does not exist, therefore it's not part of the graph.

**reverse_cost**  ``ANY-NUMERICAL``       -1     Weight of the edge `(target, source)`,

                                                 - When negative: edge `(target, source)` does not exist, therefore it's not part of the graph.
