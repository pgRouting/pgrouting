General Information

.. tsp problem definition start

Problem Definition
...............................................................................

The travelling salesperson problem (TSP) asks the following question:

  *Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, which
  is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns
  to the origin city?*

.. tsp problem definition end

Origin
...............................................................................

The traveling sales person problem was studied in the 18th century by
mathematicians **Sir William Rowam Hamilton** and **Thomas Penyngton Kirkman**.

A discussion about the work of Hamilton & Kirkman
can be found in the book **Graph Theory (Biggs et  al. 1976)**.

It is believed that the general form of the TSP have been first studied by Kalr
Menger in Vienna and Harvard.
The problem was later promoted by Hassler, Whitney & Merrill at Princeton.
A detailed description about the connection between Menger & Whitney, and the
development of the TSP can be found in `On the history of combinatorial
optimization (till 1960) <https://homepages.cwi.nl/~lex/files/histco.ps>`__

To calculate the number of different tours through :math:`n` cities:

- Given a starting city,
- There are :math:`n-1` choices for the second city,
- And  :math:`n-2` choices for the third city, etc.
- Multiplying these together we get :math:`(n-1)!  = (n-1) (n-2) . .  1`.
- Now since the travel costs do not depend on the direction taken around the
  tour:

  - this number by 2
  - :math:`(n-1)!/2`.

Characteristics
...............................................................................

- This problem is an NP-hard optimization problem.
- Metric Algorithm is used
- Implementation generates solutions that *are twice as long as the optimal tour
  in the worst case* when:

  - Graph is undirected
  - Graph is fully connected
  - Graph where traveling costs on edges obey the triangle inequality.

- On an undirected graph:

  - The traveling costs are symmetric:
  - Traveling costs from ``u`` to ``v`` are just as much as traveling from
    ``v`` to ``u``

       * When ``0`` any vertex can become the last visiting vertex before
         returning to ``start_id``.
       * When ``NOT 0`` and ``start_id = 0`` then it is the first and last
         vertex
