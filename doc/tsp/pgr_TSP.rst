Characteristics
...............................................................................

- Can be Used with :doc:`costMatrix-category` functions preferably with `directed => false`.

  - With ``directed => false``

    - Will generate a graph that:

      - is undirected
      - is fully connected (As long as the graph has one component)
      - all traveling costs on edges obey the triangle inequality.

    - When ``start_vid = 0 OR end_vid = 0``

      - The solutions generated is garanteed to be *twice as long as the
        optimal tour in the worst case*

    - When ``start_vid != 0 AND end_vid != 0 AND start_vid != end_vid``

      - It is **not garanteed** that the solution will be, in the worse case,
        twice as long as the optimal tour, due to the fact that `end_vid` is
        forced to be in a fixed position.

  - With ``directed => true``

    - It is **not garanteed** that the solution will be, in the worse case,
      twice as long as the optimal tour
    - Will generate a graph that:

      - is directed
      - is fully connected (As long as the graph has one component)
      - some (or all) traveling costs on edges might not obey the triangle inequality.

    - As an undirected graph is required, the directed graph is transformed as follows:

      - edges `(u, v)` and `(v, u)` is considered to be the same edge (denoted `(u, v)`
      - if ``agg_cost`` differs between one or more instances of edge `(u, v)`
      - The minimum value of the ``agg_cost`` all instances of edge `(u, v)`
        is going to be considered as the ``agg_cost`` of edge  `(u, v)`
      - Some (or all) traveling costs on edges will still might not obey the triangle inequality.

- When the data is incomplete, but it is a connected graph,
  the missing values will be calculated with dijkstra algorithm.

Parameters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=============== ===========  ============  =================================================
Parameter          Type         Default       Description
=============== ===========  ============  =================================================
**Matrix SQL**   ``TEXT``                   An SQL query, described in the `Matrix SQL`_ section.
**start_vid**    ``BIGINT``    ``0``        The first visiting vertex

                                            * When `0` any vertex can become the first visiting vertex.

**end_vid**      ``BIGINT``    ``0``        Last visiting vertex before returning to ``start_vid``.

                                            * When ``0`` any vertex can become the last visiting vertex before returning to ``start_vid``.
                                            * When ``NOT 0`` and ``start_vid = 0`` then it is the first and last vertex

Additional Examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Example: Start from vertex :math:`7`

* **Line 9** ``start_vid => 7``

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_TSP.queries
   :start-after: -- q2
   :end-before: -- q3
   :linenos:

:Example: Using points of interest to generate an asymetric matrix.

To generate an asymmetric matrix:

* **Line 5** The ``side`` information of pointsOfInterset is ignored by not including it in the query
* **Line 7** Generating an asymetric matrix with ``directed => true``

  * :math:`min(agg\_cost(u, v), agg\_cost(v, u))` is going to be considered as the ``agg_cost``
  * The solution that can be larger than *twice as long as the optimal tour* because:

    * Triangle inequality might not be satisfied.
    * ``start_id != 0 AND end_id != 0``

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_TSP.queries
   :start-after: -- q3
   :end-before: -- q4
   :linenos:

:Example: Connected incomplete data

Using selected edges (2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 15) the matrix is not complete but it is connected

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_TSP.queries
   :start-after: -- q4
   :end-before: -- q5
   :linenos:

Edge `(5,12)` does not exist on the initial data, but it is calculated internally.

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_TSP.queries
   :start-after: -- q5
   :end-before: -- q6
   :linenos:

The queries use the :doc:`sampledata` network.
