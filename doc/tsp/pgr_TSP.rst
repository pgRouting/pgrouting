- Can be Used with :doc:`costMatrix-category` functions preferably with
  `directed => false`.

  - With ``directed => false``

    - Will generate a graph that:

      - is undirected
      - is fully connected (As long as the graph has one component)
      - all traveling costs on edges obey the triangle inequality.

    - When ``start_vid = 0 OR end_vid = 0``

      - The solutions generated is garanteed to be *twice as long as the
        optimal tour in the worst case*

    - When ``start_vid != 0 AND end_vid != 0 AND start_vid != end_vid``

      - It is **not garanteed** that the solution will be, in the worse case,
        twice as long as the optimal tour, due to the fact that `end_vid` is
        forced to be in a fixed position.

  - With ``directed => true``

    - It is **not garanteed** that the solution will be, in the worse case,
      twice as long as the optimal tour
    - Will generate a graph that:

      - is directed
      - is fully connected (As long as the graph has one component)
      - some (or all) traveling costs on edges might not obey the triangle
        inequality.

    - As an undirected graph is required, the directed graph is transformed as
      follows:

      - edges `(u, v)` and `(v, u)` is considered to be the same edge (denoted
        `(u, v)`
      - if ``agg_cost`` differs between one or more instances of edge `(u, v)`
      - The minimum value of the ``agg_cost`` all instances of edge `(u, v)`
        is going to be considered as the ``agg_cost`` of edge `(u, v)`
      - Some (or all) traveling costs on edges will still might not obey the
        triangle inequality.

- When the data is incomplete, but it is a connected graph:

  - the missing values will be calculated with dijkstra algorithm.

Using points of interest to generate an asymetric matrix.
...............................................................................

To generate an asymmetric matrix:

* **Line 4** The ``side`` information of ``pointsOfInterset`` is ignored by not
  including it in the query
* **Line 6** Generating an asymetric matrix with ``directed => true``

  * :math:`min(agg\_cost(u, v), agg\_cost(v, u))` is going to be considered as
    the ``agg_cost``
  * The solution that can be larger than *twice as long as the optimal tour*
    because:

    * Triangle inequality might not be satisfied.
    * ``start_id != 0 AND end_id != 0``
