- Results change depending on input order of the `Matrix SQL`_
- Negative costs are ignored.
- Can be Used with :doc:`costMatrix-category` functions preferably with
  `directed => false`.

  - With ``directed => false``

    - Will generate a graph that:

      - is undirected
      - is fully connected (As long as the graph has one component)
      - all traveling costs on edges obey the triangle inequality.

    - When ``start_vid = 0 OR end_vid = 0``

      - The solutions generated are guaranteed to be *twice as long as the
        optimal tour in the worst case*

    - When ``start_vid != 0 AND end_vid != 0 AND start_vid != end_vid``

      - It is **not guaranteed** that the solution will be, in the worst case,
        twice as long as the optimal tour, due to the fact that `end_vid` is
        forced to be in a fixed position.

  - With ``directed => true``

    - It is **not guaranteed** that the solution will be, in the worst case,
      twice as long as the optimal tour
    - Will generate a graph that:

      - is directed
      - is fully connected (As long as the graph has one component)
      - some (or all) traveling costs on edges might not obey the triangle
        inequality.

    - As an undirected graph is required, the directed graph is transformed as
      follows:

      - edges `(u, v)` and `(v, u)` is considered to be the same edge (denoted
        `(u, v)`
      - if ``agg_cost`` differs between one or more instances of edge `(u, v)`
      - The minimum value of the ``agg_cost`` all instances of edge `(u, v)`
        is going to be considered as the ``agg_cost`` of edge `(u, v)`
      - Some (or all) traveling costs on edges will still might not obey the
        triangle inequality.

- When the data does not come from an undirected graph or its not fully
  connected:

  - Missing values will be calculated with dijkstra algorithm.
  - When the graph has more than one component:

    - ``start_vid`` or ``end_vid`` are defined and are on the same component:
      the TSP tour will happen on that component.
    - ``start_vid`` or ``end_vid`` are defined and are not on the same
      component: the TSP tour will propose a tour that has both components
      where connecting costs are estimated.
    - ``start_vid`` or ``end_vid`` are not defined: the starting point could be
      on any component and will include data only from that component.

- One cycle attempt to remove crossing edges is done to the TSP results.

Using points of interest to generate an asymmetric matrix.
...............................................................................

To generate an asymmetric matrix:

* **Line 4** The ``side`` information of ``pointsOfInterset`` is ignored by not
  including it in the query
* **Line 6** Generating an asymmetric matrix with ``directed => true``

  * :math:`min(agg\_cost(u, v), agg\_cost(v, u))` is going to be considered as
    the ``agg_cost``
  * The solution that can be larger than *twice as long as the optimal tour*
    because:

    * Triangle inequality might not be satisfied.
    * ``start_id != 0 AND end_id != 0``
