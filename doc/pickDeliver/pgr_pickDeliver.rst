``pgr_pickDeliver`` - Pickup and delivery Vehicle Routing Problem

.. include:: proposed.rst
   :start-after: begin-warn-expr
   :end-before: end-warn-expr



Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem: Distribute and optimize the pickup-delivery pairs into a fleet of vehicles.

- Optimization problem is NP-hard.
- pickup and Delivery with time windows.
- All vehicles are equal.

  - Same Starting location.
  - Same Ending location which is the same as Starting location.
  - All vehicles travel at the same speed.

- A customer is for doing a pickup or doing a deliver.

  - has an open time.
  - has a closing time.
  - has a service time.
  - has an (x, y) location.

- There is a customer where to deliver a pickup.

  - travel time between customers is distance / speed
  - pickup and delivery pair is done with the same vehicle.
  - A pickup is done before the delivery.


Characteristics:
----------------

- All trucks depart at time 0.
- No multiple time windows for a location.
- Less vehicle used is considered better.
- Less total duration is better.
- Less wait time is better.
- the algorithm will raise an exception when

  - If there is a pickup-deliver pair than violates time window
  - The speed, max_cycles, ma_capacity have illegal values

- Six different initial will be optimized
  - the best solution found will be result
