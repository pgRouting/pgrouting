Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem: Distribute and optimize the pickup-delivery pairs into a fleet of vehicles.

- Optimization problem is NP-hard.
- Pickup and Delivery:

  - capacitated
  - with time windows.

- The vehicles

  - have (x, y) start and ending locations.
  - have a start and ending service times.
  - have opening and closing times for the start and ending locations.

- An order is for doing a pickup and a a deliver.

  - has (x, y) pickup and delivery locations.
  - has opening and closing times for the pickup and delivery locations.
  - has a pickup and deliver service times.

- There is a customer where to deliver a pickup.

  - travel time between customers is distance / speed
  - pickup and delivery pair is done with the same vehicle.
  - A pickup is done before the delivery.



Characteristics:
----------------

- No multiple time windows for a location.
- Less vehicle used is considered better.
- Less total duration is better.
- Less wait time is better.
- Six different optional different initial solutions

  - the best solution found will be result
