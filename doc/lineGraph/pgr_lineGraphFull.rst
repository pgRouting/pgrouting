pgr_lineGraphFull - Experimental
===============================================================================

``pgr_lineGraphFull`` â€” Transforms a given graph into a new graph where all of the vertices from the original graph are converted to line graphs.

.. include:: proposed.rst
   :start-after: begin-warn-expr
   :end-before: end-warn-expr


Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This graph transformation algorithm generates a new graph that contains all of the same edges of the original graph except every vertex has been converted to a line graph. 

One application for this type of graph transformation is to allow for the addition of a cost to turning in shortest path calcuations for routing traffic. This can be done because each of the intersections (vertices) in the original graph are now line graphs that have a new edge for each possible turn across that intersection.

Characteristics
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This function is intended for directed graphs.
- This function will currently give incorrect results if negative vertex ids are used in the input.
- This function will currently give incorrect results if duplicated edge ids are used in the input.

Signature Summary
-----------------

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_lineGraphFull(edges_sql)

    RETURNS SET OF (seq,
                    source,
                    target,
                    cost,
                    edge) OR EMPTY SET

Example Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This example displays how this graph transformation works to create additional edges for each possible turn in a graph.

.. code-block:: none

    SELECT id, source, target, cost, reverse_cost FROM edge_table WHERE id IN (5, 8, 9, 11);

   :align: middle

.. code-block:: none

    SELECT * FROM pgr_lineGraphFull('SELECT id, 
                                            source, 
                                            target, 
                                            cost, 
                                            reverse_cost 
                                       FROM edge_table 
                                         WHERE id IN (5, 8, 9, 11)');

   :align: middle

In the transformed graph, all of the edges from the original graph are still present (yellow), but we now have additional edges for every turn that could be made across vertex 6 (orange).
