Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Restrictions
...............................................................................

On road networks, there are restrictions such as left or right turn restrictions,
no U turn restrictions.

A restriction is a sequence of edges, called `path` and that `path` is to be avoided.

   **Restrictions on the road network**

These restrictions are represented on a table as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tools/testers/sampledata.sql
   :start-after: --RESTRICTIONS CREATE start
   :end-before: --RESTRICTIONS CREATE end

.. note:: The table has an identifier, which maybe is needed for the administration of the restrictions, but the
   algorithms do not need that information. If given it will be ignored.
