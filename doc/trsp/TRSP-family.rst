Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Road restrictions are a sequence of road segments that can not be taken in a
sequential manner.
Some restrictions are implicit on a directed graph, for example, one way roads
where the wrong way edge is not even inserted on the graph.
But normally on turns like **left turn** or **right turn**, hence the name turn
restrictions, there are sometimes restrictions.

TRSP algorithm
...............................................................................

The internal TRSP algorithm performs a lookahead over the dijkstra algorithm in
order to find out if the attempted path has a restriction. This allows the
algorithm to pass twice on the same vertex.

Parameters
...............................................................................

.. via_parameters_start

.. list-table::
   :width: 81
   :widths: 18 20 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   * - `Edges SQL`_
     - ``TEXT``
     - `Edges SQL`_ query as described.
   * - `Restrictions SQL`_
     - ``TEXT``
     - `Restrictions SQL`_ query as described.
   * - **via vertices**
     - ``ARRAY[`` **ANY-INTEGER** ``]``
     - Array of ordered vertices identifiers that are going to be visited.

Where:

:ANY-INTEGER: SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT

.. via_parameters_end

Restrictions
...............................................................................

On road networks, there are restrictions such as left or right turn restrictions,
no U turn restrictions.

A restriction is a sequence of edges, called **path** and that **path** is to be
avoided.

.. figure:: /images/with_restrictions.png
   :scale: 50%

   **Restrictions on the road network**

These restrictions are represented on a table as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tools/testers/sampledata.sql
   :start-after: --RESTRICTIONS CREATE start
   :end-before: --RESTRICTIONS CREATE end

.. note:: The table has an identifier, which maybe is needed for the
   administration of the restrictions, but the algorithms do not need that
   information. If given it will be ignored.


Edges SQL
