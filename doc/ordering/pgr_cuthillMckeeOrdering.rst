Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In numerical linear algebra, the Cuthill-McKee algorithm (CM), named after
Elizabeth Cuthill and James McKee, is an algorithm to permute a sparse
matrix that has a symmetric sparsity pattern into a band matrix form with a
small bandwidth. The reverse Cuthill-McKee algorithm (RCM) due to Alan George
and Joseph Liu is the same algorithm but with the resulting index numbers reversed.
In practice this generally results in less fill-in than the CM ordering when
Gaussian elimination is applied.

The vertices are basically assigned a breadth-first search order, except that at
each step, the adjacent vertices are placed in the queue in order of increasing degree.

There are 3 versions defined in the Boost Graph Library. Here, we have implemented only
version 2 as it is most suitable and practical for users. In this version we don't have to 
provide the starting vertex in the query. Whereas, in the version 1 we have to provide the 
starting vertex and it gives result only for single component. Version 2 is applicable for one 
and more than one components as it finds the starting vertex itself using the pseudo-peripheral
pair heuiristic approach among each component. Maybe in future, we will also implemenent the 
version 1.

**The main Characteristics are:**

- The implementation is for **undirected** graphs.
- The bandwidth minimization problems are considered NP-complete problems. 
- The running time complexity is: :math:`O(m log(m)|V|)`

  - where :math:`|V|` is the number of vertices,
  - :math:`m` is the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph.
