"It is common to find problems with graphs that have not been constructed "
"fully noded or in graphs with zlevels at intersection that have been entered"
" incorrectly. An other problem is oneway streets that have been entered in "
"the wrong direction. We can not detect errors with respect to \"ground\" "
"truth, but we can look for inconsistencies and some anomalies in a graph and"
" report them for additional inspections."
