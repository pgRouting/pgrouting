#: ../../bdDijkstra-family.rst:35
msgid "Based on Dijkstra's algorithm, the bidirectional search finds a shortest path a starting vertex (``start_vid``) to an ending vertex (``end_vid``). It runs two simultaneous searches: one forward from the source, and one backward from the target, stopping when the two meet in the middle. This implementation can be used with a directed graph and an undirected graph."
