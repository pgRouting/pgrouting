Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In large graphs, like the road graphs, or electric networks, graph contraction
can be used to speed up some graph algorithms.
Contraction reduces the size of the graph by removing some of the vertices and
edges and, for example, might add edges that represent a sequence of original
edges decreasing the total time and space used in graph algorithms.

This implementation gives a flexible framework for adding contraction algorithms
in the future, currently, it supports two algorithms:

1. Dead end contraction
2. Linear contraction

Allowing the user to:

- Forbid contraction on a set of nodes.
- Decide the order of the contraction algorithms and set the maximum number of
  times they are to be executed.

Dead end contraction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contraction of the leaf nodes of the graph.

Dead end
..............................................................................

A node is considered a **dead end** node when

* On undirected graphs:

  * The number of adjacent vertices is 1.

* On directed graphs:

  * The number of adjacent vertices is 1.
  * There are no outgoing edges and has at least one incoming edge.
  * There are no incoming edges and has at least one outgoing edge.


When the conditions are true then the `Operation: Dead End Contraction`_ can be
done.

Dead end vertex on undirected graph
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- The green nodes are `dead end`_ nodes
- The blue nodes have an unlimited number of edges.

.. graphviz::

    graph G {
        u, v [shape=circle;style=filled;width=.4;color=deepskyblue];
        a, b [style=filled; color=green];
        G [shape=tripleoctagon;width=1.5;style=filled;
           color=deepskyblue;label = "Rest of the Graph"];

        rankdir=LR;
        G -- {u, v} [dir=none, weight=1, penwidth=3];
        u -- a [color=black];
        u -- a [color=darkgray];
        v -- b;
    }

.. list-table::
   :width: 80
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Node
     - Adjecent nodes
     - Number of adjacent nodes
   * - :math:`a`
     - :math:`\{u\}`
     - 1
   * - :math:`b`
     - :math:`\{v\}`
     - 1


Dead end vertex on directed graph
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- The green nodes are `dead end`_ nodes
- The blue nodes have an unlimited number of incoming and/or outgoing edges.

.. graphviz::

    digraph G {
        u, v, w, x, y [shape=circle;style=filled;width=.4;color=deepskyblue];
        a, b, c, d, e [style=filled; color=green];
        G [shape=tripleoctagon;width=1.5;style=filled;
           color=deepskyblue;label = "Rest of the Graph"];

        rankdir=LR;
        G -> {u, v, w} [dir=none, weight=1, penwidth=3];
        {x, y} -> G [dir=none, weight=1, penwidth=3];
        u -> a -> u;
        v -> b;
        {w, v} -> c;
        d -> x;
        e -> {x, y};
    }


.. list-table::
   :width: 80
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Node
     - Adjecent nodes
     - Number of adjacent nodes
     - Number of incoming edges
     - Number of outgoing edges
   * - :math:`a`
     - :math:`\{u\}`
     - 1
     -
     -
   * - :math:`b`
     - :math:`\{v\}`
     - 1
     -
     -
   * - :math:`c`
     - :math:`\{v, w\}`
     - 2
     - 2
     - 0
   * - :math:`d`
     - :math:`\{x\}`
     - 1
     -
     -
   * - :math:`e`
     - :math:`\{x, y\}`
     - 2
     - 0
     - 2


From above, nodes :math:`\{a, b, d\}` are dead ends because the
number of adjacent vertices is 1. No further checks are needed for those nodes.

On the following table, nodes :math:`\{c, e\}` because the
even that the number of adjacent vertices is not 1 for

* :math:`c`

  * There are no outgoing edges and has at least one incoming edge.

* :math:`e`

  * There are no incoming edges and has at least one outgoing edge.

Operation: Dead End Contraction
...............................................................................

The dead end contraction will stop until there are no more dead end nodes.
For example from the following graph where :math:`w` is the `dead end`_ node:

.. graphviz::

    digraph G {
        u, v [shape=circle;style=filled;width=.4;color=deepskyblue];
        w [style=filled; color=green];
        "G" [shape=tripleoctagon;style=filled;
        color=deepskyblue; label = "Rest of the Graph"];

        rankdir=LR;
        G -> u [dir=none, weight=1, penwidth=3];
        u -> v -> w;
    }


After contracting :math:`w`, node :math:`v` is now a `dead end`_ node and is
contracted:

.. graphviz::

    digraph G {
        u [shape=circle;style=filled;width=.4;color=deepskyblue];
        v [style=filled; color=green, label="v{w}"];
        "G" [shape=tripleoctagon;style=filled;
            color=deepskyblue; label = "Rest of the Graph"];

        rankdir=LR;
        G -> u [dir=none, weight=1, penwidth=3];
        u -> v;
    }

After contracting :math:`v`, stop. Node :math:`u` has the information of nodes
that were contrcted.

.. graphviz::

    digraph G {
        u [style=filled; color=green, label="u{v,w}"];
        "G" [shape=tripleoctagon;style=filled;
             color=deepskyblue; label = "Rest of the Graph"];

        rankdir=LR;
        G -> u [dir=none, weight=1, penwidth=3];
    }

Node :math:`u` has the information of nodes that were contracted.


Linear contraction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the algorithm, linear contraction is represented by 2.

Linear
................................................................................

In case of an undirected graph, a node is considered a `linear` node when

* The number of adjacent vertices is 2.

In case of a directed graph, a node is considered a `linear` node when

* The number of adjacent vertices is 2.
* Linearity is symmetrical

Linear vertex on undirected graph
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- The green nodes are `linear`_ nodes
- The blue nodes have an unlimited number of incoming and outgoing edges.


.. rubric:: Undirected

.. graphviz::

    graph G {
        u, w [shape=circle;style=filled;width=.4;color=deepskyblue];
        v [style=filled; color=green];
        G [shape=tripleoctagon;width=1.5;style=filled;
           color=deepskyblue;label = "Rest of the Graph"];

        rankdir=LR;
        w -- G -- u [dir=none, weight=1, penwidth=3];
        u -- v -- w;
    }

.. list-table::
   :width: 80
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Node
     - Adjecent nodes
     - Number of adjacent nodes
   * - :math:`v`
     - :math:`\{u, w\}`
     - 2

Linear vertex on directed graph
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- The green nodes are `linear`_ nodes
- The blue nodes have an unlimited number of incoming and outgoing edges.
- The white node is not linear because the linearity is not symetrical.

  * It is possible to go :math:`y \rightarrow c \rightarrow z`
  * It's not possible to go :math:`z \rightarrow c \rightarrow y`

.. graphviz::

    digraph G {
        u, v, w, x, y, z [shape=circle;style=filled;width=.4;color=deepskyblue];
        a, b [style=filled; color=green];
        G [shape=tripleoctagon;width=1.5;style=filled;
          color=deepskyblue;label = "Rest of the Graph"];

        rankdir=LR;
        {u, v} -> G -> {x, w, y, z} [dir=none, weight=1, penwidth=3];
        u -> a -> v;
        w -> b -> x;
        x -> b -> w [color=darkgray];
        y -> c -> z -> c;
    }

.. list-table::
   :width: 80
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Node
     - Adjecent nodes
     - Number of adjacent nodes
     - Is symmetrical?
   * - :math:`a`
     - :math:`\{u, v\}`
     - 2
     - yes
   * - :math:`b`
     - :math:`\{w, x\}`
     - 2
     - yes
   * - :math:`c`
     - :math:`\{y, z\}`
     - 2
     - no

Operation: Linear Contraction
...............................................................................

The linear contraction will stop when there are no more linear nodes.
For example from the following graph where :math:`v` and :math:`w` are `linear`_
nodes:

.. graphviz::

    digraph G {
        u, z [shape=circle;style=filled;color=deepskyblue];
        v, w [style=filled; color=green];
        "G" [shape=tripleoctagon; style=filled;
             color=deepskyblue;label = "Rest of the Graph"];

        rankdir=LR;
        G -> {u, z} [dir=none, weight=1, penwidth=3];
        u -> v -> w -> z;
    }

Contracting :math:`w`,

* The vertex :math:`w` is removed from the graph
* The edges :math:`v \rightarrow w` and :math:`w \rightarrow z` are removed
  from the graph.
* A new edge :math:`v \rightarrow z` is inserted represented with red color.

.. graphviz::

    digraph G {
        u, z [shape=circle;style=filled;color=deepskyblue];
        v [style=filled; color=green];
        "G" [shape=tripleoctagon; style=filled;
             color=deepskyblue;label = "Rest of the Graph"];

        rankdir=LR;
        G -> {u, z} [dir=none, weight=1, penwidth=3];
        u -> v;
        v -> z [label="{w}";color=red]
    }

Contracting :math:`v`:

* The vertex :math:`v` is removed from the graph
* The edges :math:`u \rightarrow v` and :math:`v \rightarrow z` are removed
  from the graph.
* A new edge :math:`u \rightarrow z` is inserted represented with red color.


.. graphviz::

    digraph G {
        u, z [shape=circle;style=filled;color=deepskyblue];
        "G" [shape=tripleoctagon; style=filled;
             color=deepskyblue;label = "Rest of the Graph"];

        rankdir=LR;
        G -> {u, z} [dir=none, weight=1, penwidth=3];
        u -> z [label="{v, w}";color=red]
    }

Edge :math:`u \rightarrow z` has the information of nodes that were contracted.


The cycle
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contracting a graph, can be done with more than one operation.
The order of the operations affect the resulting contracted graph, after
applying one operation, the set of vertices that can be contracted
by another operation changes.

This implementation, cycles ``max_cycles`` times through ``operations_order`` .

.. parsed-literal::

    <input>
    do max_cycles times {
        for (operation in operations_order)
         { do operation }
    }
    <output>


Contracting sample data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, building and using a contracted graph will be shown by example.

- The :doc:`sampledata` for an undirected graph is used
- a dead end operation first followed by a linear operation.

Using the contracted graph
...............................................................................

Using the contracted graph with ``pgr_dijkstra``

There are three cases when calculating the shortest path between a given source
and target in a contracted graph:

- Case 1: Both source and target belong to the contracted graph.
- Case 2: Source and/or target belong to an edge subgraph.
- Case 3: Source and/or target belong to a vertex.

Case 1: Both source and target belong to the contracted graph.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using the `Edges that belong to the contracted graph.`_ on lines 11 to 20.

.. literalinclude:: contraction-family.queries
   :emphasize-lines: 11-20
   :start-after: -- case1
   :end-before: -- use1
   :linenos:

.. rubric:: Case 1

When both source and target belong to the contracted graph, a path is found.

.. literalinclude:: contraction-family.queries
   :start-after: -- use1
   :end-before: -- use1-1

.. rubric:: Case 2

When source and/or target belong to an edge subgraph then a path is not found.

In this case, the contracted graph do not have an edge connecting with
node :math:`4`.

.. literalinclude:: contraction-family.queries
   :start-after: -- use1-1
   :end-before: -- use1-2

.. rubric:: Case 3

When source and/or target belong to a vertex then a path is not found.

In this case, the contracted graph do not have an edge connecting with
node :math:`7` and of node :math:`4` of the second case.

.. literalinclude:: contraction-family.queries
   :start-after: -- use1-2
   :end-before: -- case2

Case 2: Source and/or target belong to an edge subgraph.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Refining the above function to include nodes that belong to an edge.

- The vertices that need to be expanded are calculated on lines 11 to 17.
- Adding to the contracted graph that additional section on lines 26 to 28.

.. literalinclude:: contraction-family.queries
   :emphasize-lines: 11-17, 26-28
   :start-after: -- case2
   :end-before: -- use2
   :linenos:

.. rubric:: Case 1

When both source and target belong to the contracted graph, a path is found.

.. literalinclude:: contraction-family.queries
   :start-after: -- use2
   :end-before: -- use2-1

.. rubric:: Case 2

When source and/or target belong to an edge subgraph, now, a path is found.

The routing graph now has an edge connecting with node :math:`4`.

.. literalinclude:: contraction-family.queries
   :start-after: -- use2-1
   :end-before: -- use2-2

.. rubric:: Case 3

   :end-before: -- case3

Case 3: Source and/or target belong to a vertex.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Refining the above function to include nodes that belong to an edge.

- The vertices that need to be expanded are calculated on lines 19 to 24.
- Adding to the contracted graph that additional section on lines 38 to 40.

.. literalinclude:: contraction-family.queries
   :emphasize-lines: 19-24, 39-41
   :start-after: -- case3
   :end-before: -- use3

.. rubric:: Case 1

When both source and target belong to the contracted graph, a path is found.

.. literalinclude:: contraction-family.queries
   :start-after: -- use3

The code change do not affect this case so when source and/or target belong
to an edge subgraph, a path is still found.

.. literalinclude:: contraction-family.queries
   :start-after: -- use3-1
   :end-before: -- use3-2

.. rubric:: Case 3
