A spanning tree of an undirected graph is a tree that includes all the vertices
of G with the minimum possible number of edges.

For a disconnected graph, there there is no single tree, but a spanning forest,
consisting of a spanning tree of each connected component.

Characteristics:

.. spanntree_traits_start

* It's implementation is only on **undirected** graph.
* Process is done only on edges with positive costs.
* When the graph is connected

  * The resulting edges make up a tree

* When the graph is not connected,

  * Finds a minimum spanning tree for each connected component.
  * The resulting edges make up a forest.
