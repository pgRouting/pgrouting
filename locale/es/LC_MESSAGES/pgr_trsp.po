"The turn restricted shorthest path (TRSP) is a shortest path algorithm "
"that can optionally take into account complicated turn restrictions like "
"those found in real world navigable road networks. Performamnce wise it "
"is nearly as fast as the A* search but has many additional features like "
"it works with edges rather than the nodes of the network. Returns a set "
"of (seq, id1, id2, cost) or (seq, id1, id2, id3, cost) rows, that make up"
