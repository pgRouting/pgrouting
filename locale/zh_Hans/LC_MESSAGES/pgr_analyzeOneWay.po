#: ../../build/doc/pgr_analyzeOneWay.rst:44
msgid "The analyses of one way segments is pretty simple but can be a powerful tools to identifying some the potential problems created by setting the direction of a segment the wrong way. A node is a `source` if it has edges the exit from that node and no edges enter that node. Conversely, a node is a `sink` if all edges enter the node but none exit that node. For a `source` type node it is logically impossible to exist because no vehicle can exit the node if no vehicle and enter the node. Likewise, if you had a `sink` node you would have an infinite number of vehicle piling up on this node because you can enter it but not leave it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build/doc/pgr_analyzeOneWay.rst:46
msgid "So why do we care if the are not feasible? Well if the direction of an edge was reversed by mistake we could generate exactly these conditions. Think about a divided highway and on the north bound lane one segment got entered wrong or maybe a sequence of multiple segments got entered wrong or maybe this happened on a round-about. The result would be potentially a `source` and/or a `sink` node."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build/doc/pgr_analyzeOneWay.rst:48
msgid "So by counting the number of edges entering and exiting each node we can identify both `source` and `sink` nodes so that you can look at those areas of your network to make repairs and/or report the problem back to your data vendor."
