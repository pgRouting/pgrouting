msgid "Problem Definition"
msgstr ""

msgid "The travelling salesperson problem (TSP) asks the following question:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, which is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?*"
msgstr ""

msgid "Characteristics"
msgstr ""

msgid "This problem is an NP-hard optimization problem."
msgstr ""

msgid "Metric Algorithm is used"
msgstr ""

msgid "Implementation generates solutions that *are twice as long as the optimal tour in the worst case* when:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Graph is undirected"
msgstr ""

msgid "Graph is fully connected"
msgstr ""

msgid "Graph where traveling costs on edges obey the triangle inequality."
msgstr ""

msgid "On an undirected graph:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The traveling costs are symmetric:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Traveling costs from ``u`` to ``v`` are just as much as traveling from ``v`` to ``u``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Can be Used with :doc:`costMatrix-category` functions preferably with `directed => false`."
msgstr ""

msgid "With ``directed => false``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Will generate a graph that:"
msgstr ""

msgid "is undirected"
msgstr ""

msgid "is fully connected (As long as the graph has one component)"
msgstr ""

msgid "all traveling costs on edges obey the triangle inequality."
msgstr ""

msgid "When ``start_vid = 0 OR end_vid = 0``"
msgstr ""

msgid "The solutions generated is garanteed to be *twice as long as the optimal tour in the worst case*"
msgstr ""

msgid "When ``start_vid != 0 AND end_vid != 0 AND start_vid != end_vid``"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is **not garanteed** that the solution will be, in the worse case, twice as long as the optimal tour, due to the fact that `end_vid` is forced to be in a fixed position."
msgstr ""

msgid "With ``directed => true``"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is **not garanteed** that the solution will be, in the worse case, twice as long as the optimal tour"
msgstr ""

msgid "is directed"
msgstr ""

msgid "some (or all) traveling costs on edges might not obey the triangle inequality."
msgstr ""

msgid "As an undirected graph is required, the directed graph is transformed as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "edges `(u, v)` and `(v, u)` is considered to be the same edge (denoted `(u, v)`"
msgstr ""

msgid "if ``agg_cost`` differs between one or more instances of edge `(u, v)`"
msgstr ""

msgid "The minimum value of the ``agg_cost`` all instances of edge `(u, v)` is going to be considered as the ``agg_cost`` of edge  `(u, v)`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some (or all) traveling costs on edges will still might not obey the triangle inequality."
msgstr ""

msgid "When the data is incomplete, but it is a connected graph:"
