msgid "Sample Data"

msgid "The documentation provides very simple example queries based on a small sample network that resembles a city. To be able to execute the mayority of the examples queries, follow the instructions bellow."
msgstr ""

msgid "Main graph"

msgid "A graph consists of a set of edges and a set of vertices."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following city is to be inserted into the database:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Information known at this point is the geometry of the edges, cost values, cpacity values, category values and some locations that are not in the graph."
msgstr ""

msgid "The process to have working topology starts by inserting the edges. After that everything else is calculated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Edges"
msgstr ""

msgid "The database design for the documentation of pgRouting, keeps in the same row 2 segments, one in the direction of the geometry and the second in the oposite direction. Therfore some information has the ``reverse_`` prefix which corresponds to the segment on the oposite direction of the geometry."
