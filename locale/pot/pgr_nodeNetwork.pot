msgid "A common problem associated with bringing GIS data into pgRouting is the fact that the data is often not \"noded\" correctly. This will create invalid topologies, which will result in routes that are incorrect."

#: ../../build/doc/pgr_nodeNetwork.rst:57
msgid "What we mean by \"noded\" is that at every intersection in the road network all the edges will be broken into separate road segments. There are cases like an over-pass and under-pass intersection where you can not traverse from the over-pass to the under-pass, but this function does not have the ability to detect and accommodate those situations."

msgid "This function reads the ``edge_table`` table, that has a primary key column ``id`` and geometry column named ``the_geom`` and intersect all the segments in it against all the other segments and then creates a table ``edge_table_noded``. It uses the ``tolerance`` for deciding that multiple nodes within the tolerance are considered the same node."
