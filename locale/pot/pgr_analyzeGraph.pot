msgstr ""

msgid "RETURNS ``VARCHAR``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Prerequisites"
msgstr ""

msgid "The  edge table to be analyzed must contain a source column and a target column filled with id's of the vertices of the segments and the corresponding vertices table <edge_table>_vertices_pgr that stores the vertices information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use :doc:`pgr_createVerticesTable` to create the vertices table."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use :doc:`pgr_createTopology` to create the topology and the vertices table."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid "The analyze graph function accepts the following parameters:"
msgstr ""

msgid "edge_table"
msgstr ""

msgid "``text`` Network table name. (may contain the schema name as well)"
msgstr ""

msgid "tolerance"
msgstr ""

msgid "``float8`` Snapping tolerance of disconnected edges. (in projection unit)"
msgstr ""

msgid "the_geom"
msgstr ""

msgid "``text``  Geometry column name of the network table. Default value is ``the_geom``."
msgstr ""

msgid "id"
msgstr ""

msgid "``text``  Primary key column name of the network table. Default value is ``id``."
msgstr ""

msgid "source"
msgstr ""

msgid "``text`` Source column name of the network table. Default value is ``source``."
msgstr ""

msgid "target"
msgstr ""

msgid "``text``  Target column name of the network table.  Default value is ``target``."
msgstr ""

msgid "rows_where"
msgstr ""

msgid "``text``   Condition to select  a subset or rows.  Default value is ``true`` to indicate all rows."
msgstr ""

msgid "Uses the vertices table: <edge_table>_vertices_pgr."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fills completely the ``cnt`` and ``chk`` columns of the vertices table."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns the analysis of the section of the network defined by  ``rows_where``"
msgstr ""

msgid "The vertices table is not found."
msgstr ""

msgid "A required column of the Network table is not found or is not of the appropriate type."
msgstr ""

msgid "The condition is not well formed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The names of source , target or id are the same."
msgstr ""

msgid "The SRID of the geometry could not be determined."

msgid "The Vertices Table"
msgstr ""

msgid "The vertices table can be created with :doc:`pgr_createVerticesTable <pgr_createVerticesTable>` or :doc:`pgr_createTopology <pgr_createTopology>`"
msgstr ""

msgid "The structure of the vertices table is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``bigint`` Identifier of the vertex."
msgstr ""

msgid "cnt"
msgstr ""

msgid "``integer`` Number of vertices in the edge_table that reference this vertex."
msgstr ""

msgid "chk"
msgstr ""

msgid "``integer``  Indicator that the vertex might have a problem."
msgstr ""

msgid "ein"
msgstr ""

msgid "``integer`` Number of vertices in the edge_table that reference this vertex as incoming. See :doc:`pgr_analyzeOneWay <pgr_analyzeOneWay>`."

msgstr ""

msgid "``geometry`` Point geometry of the vertex."

msgid "Usage when the edge table's columns MATCH the default values:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The simplest way to use pgr_analyzeGraph is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Arguments are given in the order described in the parameters:"
msgstr ""

msgid "We get the same result as the simplest way to use the function."
msgstr ""

msgid "An error would occur when"
msgstr ""

msgid "the arguments are not given in the appropriate order:"
msgstr ""

msgid "In this example, the column ``id`` of the table ``mytable`` is passed to the function as the geometry column, and the geometry column ``the_geom`` is passed to the function as the id column."
msgstr ""

msgid "When using the named notation"
msgstr ""

msgid "The order of the parameters do not matter:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameters defined with a default value can be omitted, as long as the value matches the default:"

msgid "Usage when the edge table's columns DO NOT MATCH the default values:"
msgstr ""

msgid "For the following table"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using positional notation:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The arguments need to be given in the order described in the parameters:"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "In this scenario omitting a parameter would create an error because the default values for the column names do not match the column names of the table."
