msgid "Attributes associated to the tables help to indicate if the graph is directed or undirected, if an edge is one way on a directed graph, and depending on the final application needs, suitable topology(s) need to be created."

msgid "pgRouting suplies some functions to create a routing topology and to analyze the topology."
