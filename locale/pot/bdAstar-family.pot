msgid "Description"
msgstr ""

msgid "Based on A* algorithm, the bidirectional search finds a shortest path from a starting vertex (``start_vid``) to an ending vertex (``end_vid``). It runs two simultaneous searches: one forward from the ``start_vid``, and one backward from the ``end_vid``, stopping when the two meet in the middle. This implementation can be used with a directed graph and an undirected graph."
