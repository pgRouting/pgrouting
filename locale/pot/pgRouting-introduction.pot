msgid "pgRouting is an extension of `PostGIS <https://postgis.net>`_ and `PostgreSQL <http://postgresql.org>`_ geospatial database and adds routing and other network analysis functionality. A predecessor of pgRouting – pgDijkstra, written by Sylvain Pasche from `Camptocamp <http://camptocamp.com>`_, was later extended by `Orkney <http://www.orkney.co.jp>`_ and renamed to pgRouting. The project is now supported and maintained by `Georepublic <http://georepublic.info>`_, `iMaptools <http://imaptools.com/>`__ and a broad user community."
