msgid "Introduction"
msgstr ""

msgid "pgRouting is an extension of `PostGIS <https://postgis.net>`__ and `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org>`__ geospatial database and adds routing and other network analysis functionality. A predecessor of pgRouting â€“ pgDijkstra, written by Sylvain Pasche from `Camptocamp <https://camptocamp.com>`__, was later extended by Orkney and renamed to pgRouting. The project is now supported and maintained by `Georepublic <https://georepublic.info>`__, `Paragon Corporation <https://www.paragoncorporation.com/>`__ and a broad user community."
