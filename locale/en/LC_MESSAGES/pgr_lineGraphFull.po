msgid "Description"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``pgr_lineGraphFull``, converts original directed graph to a directed "
"line graph by converting each vertex to a complete graph and keeping all "
"the original edges. The new connecting edges have a cost 0 and go between"
" the adjacent original edges, respecting the directionality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A possible application of the resulting graph is **\"routing with two "
"edge restrictions\"**:"

msgid ""
"Setting a cost of using the vertex when routing between edges on the "
"connecting edge"
msgstr ""

msgid "Forbid the routing between two edges by removing the connecting edge"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is possible because each of the intersections (vertices) in the "
"original graph are now complete graphs that have a new edge for each "
"possible turn across that intersection."
msgstr ""

msgid "The main characteristics are:"

msgid "This function is for **directed** graphs."
