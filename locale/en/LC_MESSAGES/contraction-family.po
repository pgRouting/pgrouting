msgid "Introduction"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In large graphs, like the road graphs, or electric networks, graph "
"contraction can be used to speed up some graph algorithms. Contraction "
"reduces the size of the graph by removing some of the vertices and edges "
"and, for example, might add edges that represent a sequence of original "
"edges decreasing the total time and space used in graph algorithms."

msgid ""
"This implementation gives a flexible framework for adding contraction "
"algorithms in the future, currently, it supports two algorithms:"
