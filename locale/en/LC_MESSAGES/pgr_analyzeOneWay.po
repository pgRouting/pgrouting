msgid ""
"The analyses of one way segments is pretty simple but can be a powerful "
"tools to identifying some the potential problems created by setting the "
"direction of a segment the wrong way. A node is a `source` if it has "
"edges the exit from that node and no edges enter that node. Conversely, a"
" node is a `sink` if all edges enter the node but none exit that node. "
"For a `source` type node it is logically impossible to exist because no "
"vehicle can exit the node if no vehicle and enter the node. Likewise, if "
"you had a `sink` node you would have an infinite number of vehicle piling"
" up on this node because you can enter it but not leave it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build/doc/pgr_analyzeOneWay.rst:42
msgid ""
"So why do we care if the are not feasible? Well if the direction of an "
"edge was reversed by mistake we could generate exactly these conditions. "
"Think about a divided highway and on the north bound lane one segment got"
" entered wrong or maybe a sequence of multiple segments got entered wrong"
" or maybe this happened on a round-about. The result would be potentially"
" a `source` and/or a `sink` node."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build/doc/pgr_analyzeOneWay.rst:44
msgid ""
"So by counting the number of edges entering and exiting each node we can "
"identify both `source` and `sink` nodes so that you can look at those "
"areas of your network to make repairs and/or report the problem back to "
"your data vendor."
