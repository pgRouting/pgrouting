"The prim algorithm was developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtěch "
"Jarník. It is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a"
" weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges "
"that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of "
"all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by "
"building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting "
"vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the "
"tree to another vertex."

"This algorithms find the minimum spanning forest in a possibly "
"disconnected graph; in contrast, the most basic form of Prim's algorithm "
"only finds minimum spanning trees in connected graphs. However, running "
"Prim's algorithm separately for each connected component of the graph, "
"then it is called minimum spanning forest."
