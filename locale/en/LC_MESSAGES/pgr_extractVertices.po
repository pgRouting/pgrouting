"That information is correct, for example, when in terms of vehicles, is "

msgid "It might be incorrect, for example:"

msgid "When it is incorrect, it needs fixing:"
msgstr ""

msgid "For vehicles and pedestrians"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the data comes from OSM and was imported to the database using "

"<https://www.openstreetmap.org>`__ and the data imported again."

"The data is correct when from the point of view of routing vehicles or "

msgid ""
"Once analyzed one by one the crossings, for the ones that need a local "

msgid ""
"The new edges need to be added to the edges table, the rest of the "

msgid "Adding split edges"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For each pair of crossing edges a process similar to this one must be "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The columns inserted and the way are calculated are based on the "

"column is to be copied."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**factor** based on the position of the intersection of the edges can be "

msgid "Adding new vertices"

msgid "Removing the surplus edges"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once all significant information needed by the application has been "
