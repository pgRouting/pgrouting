msgid "The travelling salesperson problem (TSP) asks the following question:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, "
"which is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once "
"and returns to the origin city?*"

msgid ""
"The traveling sales person problem was studied in the 18th century by "
"mathematicians **Sir William Rowam Hamilton** and **Thomas Penyngton "
"Kirkman**."

"A discussion about the work of Hamilton & Kirkman can be found in the "

"It is believed that the general form of the TSP have been first studied "
"by Kalr Menger in Vienna and Harvard. The problem was later promoted by "
"Hassler, Whitney & Merrill at Princeton. A detailed description about the"
" connection between Menger & Whitney, and the development of the TSP can "
"be found in `On the history of combinatorial optimization (till 1960) "
