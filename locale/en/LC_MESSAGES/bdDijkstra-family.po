msgid "Synopsis"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Based on Dijkstra's algorithm, the bidirectional search finds a shortest "
"path a starting vertex to an ending vertex."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It runs two simultaneous searches: one forward from the source, and one "
"backward from the target, stopping when the two meet in the middle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This implementation can be used with a directed graph and an undirected "
"graph."

msgid "Characteristics"
msgstr ""

msgid "The main Characteristics are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Process is done only on edges with positive costs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A negative value on a cost column is interpreted as the edge does not "
"exist."
msgstr ""

msgid "Values are returned when there is a path."
msgstr ""

msgid "When there is no path:"
msgstr ""

msgid "When the starting vertex and ending vertex are the same."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **aggregate cost** of the non included values :math:`(v, v)` is "
":math:`0`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the starting vertex and ending vertex are the different and there is"
" no path:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **aggregate cost** the non included values :math:`(u, v)` is "
":math:`\\infty`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For optimization purposes, any duplicated value in the starting vertices "
"or on the ending vertices are ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running time (worse case scenario): :math:`O((V \\log V + E))`"

"For large graphs where there is a path bewtween the starting vertex and "
"ending vertex:"
