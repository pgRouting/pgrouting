"pgRouting is an extension of `PostGIS <http://postgis.net>`_ and `PostgreSQL"
" <http://postgresql.org>`_ geospatial database and adds routing and other "
"network analysis functionality. A predecessor of pgRouting – pgDijkstra, "
"written by Sylvain Pasche from `Camptocamp <http://camptocamp.com>`_, was "
"later extended by `Orkney <http://www.orkney.co.jp>`_ and renamed to "
"pgRouting. The project is now supported and maintained by `Georepublic "
"<http://georepublic.info>`_, `iMaptools <http://imaptools.com/>`__ and a "
"broad user community."
