msgid "Description"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The turn restricted shorthest path (TRSP) is a shortest path algorithm "
"that can optionally take into account complicated turn restrictions like "
"those found in real world navigable road networks. Performamnce wise it "
"is nearly as fast as the A* search but has many additional features like "
"it works with edges rather than the nodes of the network. Returns a set "
"of (seq, id1, id2, cost) or (seq, id1, id2, id3, cost) rows, that make up"
" a path."

msgid ""
"The Turn Restricted Shortest Path algorithm (TRSP) is similar to the "

"The TRSP setup is mostly the same as :doc:`Dijkstra shortest path "
"<pgr_dijkstra>` with the addition of an optional turn restriction table. "
"This provides an easy way of adding turn restrictions to a road network "

"pgr_trsp code has issues that are not being fixed yet, but as time passes"
