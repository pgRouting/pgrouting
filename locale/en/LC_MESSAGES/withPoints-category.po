msgid "Introduction"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **with points** category modifies the graph on the fly by adding "
"points on edges as required by the `Points SQL`_ query."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The functions within this category give the ability to process between "
"arbitrary points located outside the original graph."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This category of functions was thought for routing vehicles, but might as"
" well work for some other application not involving vehicles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When given a point identifier ``pid`` that its being mapped to an edge "
"with an identifier ``edge_id``, with a fraction from the source to the "
"target along the edge ``fraction`` and some additional information about "
"which side of the edge the point is on ``side``, then processing from "
"arbitrary points can be done on fixed networks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All this functions consider as many traits from the \"real world\" as "
"possible:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Kind of graph:"

msgid "**directed** graph"

msgid "**Right** side driving"

msgid "Some points are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Permanent**: for example the set of points of clients stored in a table"
" in the data base."
msgstr ""

msgid "The graph has been modified to permanently have those points as vertices."
msgstr ""

msgid "There is a table on the database that describes the points"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Temporal**: for example points given through a web application"
msgstr ""

msgid "The numbering of the points are handled with negative sign."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This sign change is to avoid confusion when there is a vertex with the "
"same identifier as the point identifier."

msgid "Original point identifiers are to be positive."
