msgid "Description"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sequential vertex coloring algorithm is a graph coloring algorithm in "
"which color identifiers are assigned to the vertices of a graph in a "
"sequential manner, such that no edge connects two identically colored "
"vertices."
msgstr ""

msgid "**The main Characteristics are:**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The implementation is applicable only for **undirected** graphs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Provides the color to be assigned to all the vertices present in the "
"graph."
msgstr ""

msgid "Color identifiers values are in the Range :math:`[1, |V|]`"
msgstr ""

msgid "The algorithm tries to assign the least possible color to every vertex."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Efficient graph coloring is an NP-Hard problem, and therefore, this "
"algorithm does not always produce optimal coloring. It follows a greedy "
"strategy by iterating through all the vertices sequentially, and "
"assigning the smallest possible color that is not used by its neighbors, "
"to each vertex."
msgstr ""

msgid "The returned rows are ordered in ascending order of the vertex value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sequential Vertex Coloring Running Time: :math:`O(|V|*(d + k))`"
msgstr ""

msgid "where :math:`|V|` is the number of vertices,"
msgstr ""

msgid ":math:`d` is the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph,"
msgstr ""

msgid ":math:`k` is the number of colors used."
