msgid "**Official** function"

msgid "The function returns:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``OK`` after the network topology has been built and the vertices table "

msgid "The Vertices Table"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The vertices table is a requirement of the :doc:`pgr_analyzeGraph` and "
"the :doc:`pgr_analyzeOneWay` functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "The structure of the vertices table is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``bigint`` Identifier of the vertex."
msgstr ""

msgid "cnt"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``integer`` Number of vertices in the edge_table that reference this "
"vertex. See :doc:`pgr_analyzeGraph`."

msgid ""
"``integer``  Indicator that the vertex might have a problem. See "

"``integer`` Number of vertices in the edge_table that reference this "

msgstr ""

msgid "``geometry`` Point geometry of the vertex."

msgid "Usage when the edge table's columns MATCH the default values:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The simplest way to use pgr_createTopology is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "When the arguments are given in the order described:"
msgstr ""

msgid "We get the same result AS the simplest way to use the function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An error would occur when the arguments are not given in the appropriate "
"order: In this example, the column ``id`` of the table ``ege_table`` is "
"passed to the function as the geometry column, and the geometry column "
"``the_geom`` is passed to the function as the id column."
msgstr ""

msgid "When using the named notation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Parameters defined with a default value can be omitted, as long as the "
"value matches the default And The order of the parameters would not "

msgid "For the following table"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using positional notation:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The arguments need to be given in the order described in the parameters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that this example uses clean flag. So it recreates the whole "
"vertices table."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An error would occur when the arguments are not given in the appropiriate"
" order: In this example, the column ``gid`` of the table ``mytable`` is "
"passed to the function AS the geometry column, and the geometry column "
"``mygeom`` is passed to the function AS the id column."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this scenario omitting a parameter would create an error because the "
"default values for the column names do not match the column names of the "
"table. The order of the parameters do not matter:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Based on id:"

msgid "Additional Examples"

msgid "Create a routing topology"

msgid ""
"An alternate method to create a routing topology use "
