"Based on A* algorithm, the bidirectional search finds a shortest path "
"from a starting vertex (``start_vid``) to an ending vertex (``end_vid``)."
" It runs two simultaneous searches: one forward from the ``start_vid``, "
"and one backward from the ``end_vid``, stopping when the two meet in the "
"middle. This implementation can be used with a directed graph and an "
"undirected graph."
