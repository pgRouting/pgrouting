"The function reads edges from a not \"noded\" network table and writes "
"the \"noded\" edges into a new table."

msgid "Description"
msgstr ""

msgid "**The main characteristics are:**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common problem associated with bringing GIS data into pgRouting is the "
"fact that the data is often not \"noded\" correctly. This will create "
"invalid topologies, which will result in routes that are incorrect."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What we mean by \"noded\" is that at every intersection in the road "
"network all the edges will be broken into separate road segments. There "
"are cases like an over-pass and under-pass intersection where you can not"
" traverse from the over-pass to the under-pass, but this function does "
"not have the ability to detect and accommodate those situations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function reads the ``edge_table`` table, that has a primary key "
"column ``id`` and geometry column named ``the_geom`` and intersect all "
"the segments in it against all the other segments and then creates a "
"table ``edge_table_noded``. It uses the ``tolerance`` for deciding that "
"multiple nodes within the tolerance are considered the same node."

"To get the same analysis results as the original edge_table, we do the "

msgid ""
"Or we can analyze everything because, maybe edge 18 is an overpass, edge "
