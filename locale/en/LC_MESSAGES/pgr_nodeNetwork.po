"A common problem associated with bringing GIS data into pgRouting is the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../build/doc/pgr_nodeNetwork.rst:57

"What we mean by \"noded\" is that at every intersection in the road "
"network all the edges will be broken into separate road segments. There "
"are cases like an over-pass and under-pass intersection where you can not"
" traverse from the over-pass to the under-pass, but this function does "

"This function reads the ``edge_table`` table, that has a primary key "
"column ``id`` and geometry column named ``the_geom`` and intersect all "
"the segments in it against all the other segments and then creates a "
"table ``edge_table_noded``. It uses the ``tolerance`` for deciding that "
"multiple nodes within the tolerance are considered the same node."
