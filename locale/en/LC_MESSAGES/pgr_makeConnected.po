msgid "Description"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Adds the minimum number of edges needed to make the input graph "
"connected. The algorithm first identifies all of the connected components"
" in the graph, then adds edges to connect those components together in a "
"path. For example, if a graph contains three connected components A, B, "
"and C, make_connected will add two edges. The two edges added might "
"consist of one connecting a vertex in A with a vertex in B and one "
"connecting a vertex in B with a vertex in C."
