Contributions should be developed by the contributor, from the public domain, or from an open source project under a compatible liscence. If the code does not come from the contributor, the original source should be clearly marked. 

Do not remove existing copyright headers and liscence text from contributions. If the copyright holder wants to give up copyright, they must do so in writing before any copyright messages are deleted. 

## Submitting changes

Write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small
changes, but bigger changes should have more information.

Fill in the commit message template.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for
readability.

This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and
make it look nice for them.

* We indent using four spaces (soft tabs)
* We use cpplint for linting C/C++ code.

Thanks,
pgRouting team
