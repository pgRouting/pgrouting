Experimental and Proposed functions
===============================================================================

:ref:`proposed`

These are proposed functions

  - They are not officially of the current release.
  - They likely will not be officialy be part of the version 2.3 release:

    - The functions might not make use of ANY-INTEGER and ANY-NUMERICAL
    - Name might change.
    - Signature might change.
    - Functionality might change.
    - pgTap tests might not being done.
    - Might need c/c++ coding.
    - May lack documentation,
    - Documentation if any might need to be rewritten.
    - Documentation examples might need to be automatically generated.
    - Might need a lot of feedback from the comunity.
    - Might need a non official function of pgRouting
    - Might need a deprecated function of pgRouting


Proposed functions: Proposed by Steve Woodbridge
------------------------------------------------

:ref:`convenience_functions`
  -  :ref:`pgr_point_to_edgenode` - convert a point geometry to a ``vertex_id`` based on closest edge.
  -  :ref:`pgr_flip_edges` - flip the edges in an array of geometries so the connect end to end.
  -  :ref:`pgr_text_to_points` - convert a string of ``x,y;x,y;...`` locations into point geometries.
  -  :ref:`pgr_points_to_vids` - convert an array of point geometries into vertex ids.
  -  :ref:`pgr_points_to_dmatrix` - Create a distance matrix from an array of points.
  -  :ref:`pgr_vids_to_dmatrix` - Create a distance matrix from an array of ``vertix_id``.
  -  :ref:`pgr_vids_to_dmatrix2` - Create a distance matrix from an array of ``vertix_id``.
