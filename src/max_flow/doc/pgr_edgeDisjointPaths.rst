Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculates the edge disjoint paths between two groups of vertices.
Utilizes underlying maximum flow algorithms to calculate the paths.

Characteristics:
----------------

The main characterics are:
  - Calculates the edge disjoint paths between any two groups of vertices.
  - Returns EMPTY SET when source and destination are the same, or cannot be reached.
  - The graph can be directed or undirected.
  - One to many, many to one, many to many versions are also supported.
  - Uses :ref:`pgr_boykovKolmogorov` to calculate the paths.

Minimal use
.................

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_edgeDisjointPaths(edges_sql, start_vid, end_vid)
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_id, path_seq, node, edge, cost, agg_cost)
    OR EMPTY SET

The minimal use is for a **directed** graph from one ``start_vid`` to one ``end_vid``.

:Example:

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_edgeDisjointPaths.queries
   :start-after: -- q1
   :end-before: -- q2

.. index::
    single: edgeDisjointPaths(One to One) - Proposed

One to One
.......................................

This signature finds the set of dijoint paths from one ``start_vid`` to one ``end_vid``:
  -  on a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
  -  on an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.

.. index::
    single: edgeDisjointPaths(One to Many) - Proposed

One to Many
.......................................

This signature finds the sset of disjoint paths  from the ``start_vid`` to each one of the ``end_vid`` in ``end_vids``:
  - on a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
  - on an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.
  - The result is equivalent to the union of the results of the one to one `pgr_edgeDisjointPaths`.
  - The extra ``end_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.
