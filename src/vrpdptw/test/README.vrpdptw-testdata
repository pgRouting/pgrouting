# Li & Lim benchmark

Here you find instance definitions and the best known solutions
(to our knowledge) for the 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 customer
instances of Li & Lim's PDPTW benchmark problems. The version reported
here has a hierarchical objective:

 1. Minimize number of vehicles
 2. Minimize total distance.

Distance and time should be calculated with double precision, total
distance results are rounded to two decimals. Exact methods typically
use a total distance objective and use integral or low precision distance
and time calculations. Hence, results are not directly comparable.

This data base was built from data published at
http://www.sintef.no/Projectweb/TOP/PDPTW/Li--Lim-benchmark/

The data loads into a schema named "testdata" and there are 352 test cases
with each test cases loaded into a table. there is a summary table called
"pdp_problems" which lists each data table as "instance" and provides
additional information about the best know result and the number of
vehicles and vehicle capacity for each test cases.

You might load these with commands like:

```
createdb -U postgres -h localhost vrpdptw_tests
zcat vrpdptw-testdata.sql.gz | psql -U postgres -h localhost vrpdptw_tests
```
