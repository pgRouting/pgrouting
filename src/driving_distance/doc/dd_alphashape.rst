.. index:: 
	single: pgr_alphashape(text)
	module: driving_distance

Name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``pgr_alphashape`` â€” Core function for alpha shape computation.


Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Returns a table with (x, y) rows that describe the vertices of an alpha shape.

.. code-block:: sql

	table() pgr_alphashape(text sql);


Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:sql: ``text`` a SQL query, which should return a set of rows with the following columns:

    .. code-block:: sql

        SELECT id, x, y FROM vertex_table

    :id: ``int4`` identifier of the vertex
    :x: ``float8`` x-coordinate
    :y: ``float8`` y-coordinate


Returns a vertex record for each row :

:x: x-coordinate
:y: y-coordinate


.. rubric:: History

* Renamed in version 2.0.0


Examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the alpha shape code we have no way to control the order of the points so the actual output you might get could be similar but different. The simple query is followed by a more complex one that constructs a polygon and computes the areas of it. This should be the same as the result on your system. We leave the details of the complex query to the reader as an exercise if they wish to decompose it into understandable pieces or to just copy and paste it into a SQL window to run.

The queries use the :ref:`sampledata` network.
