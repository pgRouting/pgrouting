===============================================================================


Name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``pgr_withPoints`` - Returns the shortest path in a graph with additional temporary vertices.

.. note::  This is a proposed function for version 2.3.

     - Is not officially in the version 2.2 release.

   Boost Graph Inside

Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modify the graph to include points defined by points_sql. 
Using Dijkstra algorithm, find the shortest path(s)

Characteristics:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main Characteristics are:

  - Process is done only on edges with positive costs.
  - Vertices of the graph are:

    - **positive** when it belongs to the edges_sql
    - **negative** when it belongs to the points_sql

  - Values are returned when there is a path.

   - When the starting vertex and ending vertex are the same, there is no path.

    - The agg_cost the non included values (v, v) is 0

   - When the starting vertex and ending vertex are the different and there is no path:

    - The agg_cost the non included values (u, v) is ∞

  - For optimization purposes, any duplicated value in the start_vids or end_vids are ignored.
  - The returned values are ordered:

    - start_vid ascending
    - end_vid ascending

  - Runing time: :math:`O(|start\_vids|∗(V \log V + E))`

Minimal signature
-----------------

The minimal signature:
    - Is for a **directed** graph.
    - The driving side is set as **b** both. So arriving/departing to/from the point(s) can be in any direction.
    - No **details** are given about distance of other points of points_sql query.

================ ====================== =================================================
Parameter        Type                   Description

**edges_sql**    ``TEXT``               Edges SQL query as decribed above.
**points_sql**   ``TEXT``               Points SQL query as decribed above.
**start_vid**    ``ANY-INTEGER``        Starting vertex identifier. When negative: is a point's pid.
**end_vid**      ``ANY-INTEGER``        Ending vertex identifier. When negative: is a point's pid.
**start_vids**   ``ARRAY[ANY-INTEGER]`` Array of identifiers of starting vertices. When negative: is a point's pid.
**end_vids**     ``ARRAY[ANY-INTEGER]`` Array of identifiers of ending vertices. When negative: is a point's pid.
**directed**     ``BOOLEAN``            (optional). When ``false`` the graph is considered as Undirected. Default is ``true`` which considers the graph as Directed.
**driving_side** ``CHAR``               (optional) Value in ['b', 'r', 'l', NULL] indicating if the driving side is:

**details**      ``BOOLEAN``            (optional). When ``true`` the results will include the points in points_sql that are in the path.
                                        Default is ``false`` which ignores other points of the points_sql.
