pgr_withPointsCost
===============================================================================


Name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``pgr_withPointsCost`` - Calculates the shortest path and returns only the aggregate cost of the shortest path(s) found, for the combination of points given.

.. note::  This is a proposed function for version 2.3.

     - Is not officially in the version 2.2 release.

Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modify the graph to include points defined by points_sql.
Using Dijkstra algorithm, return only the aggregate cost of the shortest path(s) found.

Characteristics:
----------------

The main Characteristics are:
  - It does not return a path.
  - Returns the sum of the costs of the shortest path for pair combination of vertices in the modified graph.
  - Vertices of the graph are:

    - **positive** when it belongs to the edges_sql
    - **negative** when it belongs to the points_sql

  - Process is done only on edges with positive costs.
  - Values are returned when there is a path.

    - The returned values are in the form of a set of `(start_vid, end_vid, agg_cost)`.

    - When the starting vertex and ending vertex are the same, there is no path.

      - The `agg_cost` in the non included values `(v, v)` is `0`

    - When the starting vertex and ending vertex are the different and there is no path.

      - The `agg_cost` in the non included values `(u, v)` is :math:`\infty`

  - If the values returned are stored in a table, the unique index would be the pair:
    `(start_vid, end_vid)`.

  - For undirected graphs, the results are symmetric.

    - The  `agg_cost` of `(u, v)` is the same as for `(v, u)`.

  - For optimization purposes, any duplicated value in the `start_vids` or `end_vids` is ignored.

  - The returned values are ordered:

    - `start_vid` ascending
    - `end_vid` ascending

  - Running time: :math:`O(| start\_vids | * (V \log V + E))`

Signatures
==========

.. index::
    single: withPointsCost(edges_sql, points_sql, start_pid, end_pid) -- proposed

Minimal Usage
-----------------

The minimal signature:
    - Is for a **directed** graph.
    - The driving side is set as **b** both. So arriving/departing to/from the point(s) can be in any direction.

.. code-block:: none
