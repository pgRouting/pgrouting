Topology Functions
===============================================================================

The pgRouting's topology of a network, represented with an edge table with source and target attributes and a vertices table associated with it. 
Depending on the algorithm, you can create a topology or just reconstruct the vertices table, You can analyze the topology, 
We also provide a function to node an unoded network.

  -  :ref:`pgr_create_topology` -  to create a topology based on the geometry. 
  -  :ref:`pgr_create_vert_table` - to reconstruct the vertices table based on the source and target information.
  -  :ref:`pgr_analyze_graph`  - to analyze the edges and vertices of the edge table.
  -  :ref:`pgr_analyze_oneway` - to analyze directionality of the edges.
  -  :ref:`pgr_node_network`  -to create nodes to a not noded edge table.
