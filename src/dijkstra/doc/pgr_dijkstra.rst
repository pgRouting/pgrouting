Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956.
It is a graph search algorithm that solves the shortest path problem for
a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path from
a starting vertex (``start_vid``) to an ending vertex (``end_vid``).
This implementation can be used with a directed graph and an undirected graph.

Characteristics:
----------------

The main Characteristics are:
  - Process is done only on edges with positive costs.
  - Values are returned when there is a path.

    - When the starting vertex and ending vertex are the same, there is no path.

      - The `agg_cost` the non included values `(v, v)` is `0`

    - When the starting vertex and ending vertex are the different and there is no path:

      - The `agg_cost` the non included values `(u, v)` is :math:`\infty`

  - For optimization purposes, any duplicated value in the `start_vids` or `end_vids` are ignored.

  - The returned values are ordered:

    - `start_vid` ascending
    - `end_vid` ascending

  - Runing time: :math:`O(| start\_vids | * (V \log V + E))`

Minimal signature
-----------------

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_dijkstra(TEXT edges_sql, BIGINT start_vid, BIGINT end_vid)
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

The minimal signature is for a **directed** graph from one ``start_vid`` to one ``end_vid``:

:Example:

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_dijkstra.queries
   :start-after: -- q1
   :end-before: -- q2


.. index::
    single: dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vid, end_vid, directed:=TRUE)

Dijkstra One to One
-------------------

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_dijkstra(TEXT edges_sql, BIGINT start_vid, BIGINT end_vid,
        BOOLEAN directed:=true);
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

This signature finds the shortest path from one ``start_vid`` to one ``end_vid``:
  -  on a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
  -  on an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.

:Example:

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_dijkstra.queries
   :start-after: -- q2
   :end-before: -- q3


.. index::
    single: dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vid, end_vids, directed:=TRUE)

Dijkstra One to many
--------------------

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_dijkstra(TEXT edges_sql, BIGINT start_vid, ARRAY[ANY_INTEGER] end_vids,
        BOOLEAN directed:=true);
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, end_vid, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

This signature finds the shortest path from one ``start_vid`` to each ``end_vid`` in ``end_vids``:
  -  on a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
  -  on an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.

Using this signature, will load once the graph and perform a one to one `pgr_dijkstra`
where the starting vertex is fixed, and stop when all ``end_vids`` are reached.

  - The result is equivalent to the union of the results of the one to one `pgr_dijkstra`.
  - The extra ``end_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.

:Example:

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_dijkstra.queries
   :start-after: -- q3
   :end-before: -- q4




.. index::
    single: dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vids, end_vid, directed)

Dijkstra Many to One
--------------------

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_dijkstra(TEXT edges_sql, ARRAY[ANY_INTEGER] start_vids, BIGINT end_vid,
        BOOLEAN directed:=true);
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, start_vid, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

This signature finds the shortest path from each ``start_vid`` in  ``start_vids`` to one ``end_vid``:
  -  on a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
  -  on an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.

Using this signature, will load once the graph and perform several one to one `pgr_dijkstra`
where the ending vertex is fixed.

  - The result is the union of the results of the one to one `pgr_dijkstra`.
  - The extra ``start_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.

:Example:

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_dijkstra.queries
   :start-after: -- q4
   :end-before: -- q5



.. index::
    single: dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vids, end_vids, directed)

Dijkstra Many to Many
---------------------

.. code-block:: none

    pgr_dijkstra(TEXT edges_sql, ARRAY[ANY_INTEGER] start_vids, ARRAY[ANY_INTEGER] end_vids,
        BOOLEAN directed:=true);
    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, start_vid, end_vid, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

This signature finds the shortest path from each ``start_vid`` in  ``start_vids`` to each ``end_vid`` in ``end_vids``:
  -  on a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
  -  on an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.

Using this signature, will load once the graph and perform several one to Many `pgr_dijkstra`
for all ``start_vids``.

  - The result is the union of the results of the one to one `pgr_dijkstra`.
  - The extra ``start_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.

The extra ``start_vid`` and ``end_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.

:Example:

.. literalinclude:: doc-pgr_dijkstra.queries
   :start-after: -- q5
   :end-before: -- q6
